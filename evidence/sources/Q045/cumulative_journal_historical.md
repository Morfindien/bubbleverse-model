# BUBBLEVERSE — Q045 REFERENCE HISTORY V1 INGESTION / V2 OFFLINE RECOVERY

DATE AND TIME: 2026-10-10T09:19:09.033675+00:00 (UTC).
CURRENT Q: Q-045 / Q045 — PROPOSED_CANONICAL_REGISTRATION_PENDING.
CASE ID: NOT DOCUMENTED.
EXACT QUESTION: For the frozen Q041 ΛCDM and n_scf=3 EDE configurations, does replacing only the native optical-depth integration functional with a convergent Thomson-integral reference, at identical requested tau_reio and otherwise unchanged physical inputs, alter CMB TT/TE/EE predictions and native likelihood values enough to threaten the original H0/EDE decision margins?
STATUS: CONTINUES. No scientific closure or model revision is established by this repair.
RECOMMENDED CHATGPT SETTING: current Work/Codex, strong reasoning (High if selectable); focused repository and offline numerical debugging. Current configured effort and account-specific ASTRA MAX/model menu are not visible. GPT-5.6 with comparable code/repository capability is an if-available fallback. No model switch or subagents used.

KEEP: the exact incoming executed journal follows verbatim (627359 bytes, SHA256 `20e7f963d2be02c85fcb83d716bacfa3becb975cbdec878f1364eab5e6e165a3`). All existing source IDs/claim mappings, Q041 scientific freezes, accepted v0.5/R000005 through Q043, closed Q042/Q044 states and previous successes/failures survive. This differential update governs current status; old prospective “not computed” statements are historical.

ADD — J-Q045-RECOVERY-01 [RUN_FAILURE / TECHNICAL EVIDENCE]: original reference-history V1 run38039690879 at commit849f33d54d31c58c58cba37d5134e240987741fe completed all8 native background/thermodynamics evaluations. Six worker analyses passed; HiLLiPoP LCDM-L1 and EDE-L1 failed only afterward with exact error `ValueError: UNCHANGED_PHYSICAL_NORMALIZATION YHe`. Original failed outcomes remain FAILED historically. The full run is not relabeled as a successful Actions execution.

ADD — J-Q045-RECOVERY-02 [ROOT CAUSE / CORRECTED VALIDATION]: both failed workers report YHe=0.2453270944664975; their respective L0 parents report0.24532709446649748. Difference=2.7755575615628914e-17, exactly1 binary64 ULP. All frozen requested physical dictionaries, requested tau_reio, nine numerical settings/effective precision whitelist and recorded nH0/fHe/physical constants remain exact under existing checks. The strict V1 equality test treated derived BBN YHe as an invariant input. Pinned source K-Q045-REFHIST-SOURCE-001, `thermodynamics_helium_from_bbn`, calls background_at_z at BBN and obtains Neff for interpolation; output therefore depends on the numerical background. This is consistent with numerical rounding under refinement; the source does not uniquely prove a particular floating-point operation caused the1ULP change. It supplies no physics falsification or new anomaly claim.

UPDATE — J-Q045-RECOVERY-03 [FINITE CORRECTION / NO SCIENTIFIC CHANGE]: Q045-REFHIST-V2 only retrieves and reanalyzes the frozen original artifacts. It permits≤1ULP only for BBN-derived YHe and records old/new/delta/ULP/bitwise-equality status. Explicit numeric YHe, changed requested inputs, larger drift and any normalization-constant change remain rejected. No raw value is changed, rounded, clipped or substituted. No CLASS source/binary build, native execution, cache restore, new refinement, CMB/likelihood, fit, sampler or production run exists in the V2 execution target.

ADD — J-Q045-RECOVERY-04 [ACTUAL RECOVERED RESULT]: all10 source archives match official byte counts/SHA256; every member matches its frozen inventory and original worker hash inventory. Offline analysis recovers8/8 histories, and all6 originally successful numerical summaries reproduce exactly using NumPy1.26.4. Local Python differs from original runner (3.12 versus3.11.16); exact reproduction is checked rather than assumed. There are4 L0/L1/L2 common-grid comparisons. L1 has56666 native nodes; L2 has113333. Opacity, scalar calibration, trace completeness, precision and input gates pass as component diagnostics. Original statuses and errors are retained alongside recovery status. Actual runtime metadata are in the final JSON.

| Point | Accepted native tau L0 | L1 | L2 | max xe drift L0→L1, z≤50 | L1→L2 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| camspec-ede_n3 | 0.05141522621 | 0.05141992655 | 0.05141902842 | 0.000569497 | 9.49163e-05 |
| camspec-lcdm | 0.05141528223 | 0.05141998267 | 0.05141908455 | 0.000569499 | 9.49161e-05 |
| hillipop-ede_n3 | 0.05150733944 | 0.05150539545 | 0.0515061513 | 0.000189823 | 9.49126e-05 |

All tau and xe values/differences above are dimensionless diagnostic quantities. Tables show numerical calculation precision, not physical accuracy. All4 accepted-tau sequences change direction across levels: no positive Richardson order/remaining estimate exists for these sequences. Calibrated z_reio/support drift is mixed with history refinement; no isolated continuum error is identified. The full-domain redshift32 versus eta-cubic difference remains about0.0666–0.0669 at L1 and0.01666–0.01674 at L2; below z≤1500 it is about9.24e-8–9.51e-8 at L1 and2.31e-8–2.38e-8 at L2. These are representation discrepancies with sampled H, not global physical-reference bounds. Unexpected values and all native rows remain preserved, not normalized away.

UPDATE — J-Q045-RECOVERY-05 [EXACT BUDGET / STOP]: 4 FULL baseline starts +4 prior telemetry observations +8 completed refinement observations =16/52 consumed;36 remain. Offline recovery adds0. The prior48-FULL matrix still requires44 further FULL calls; the cap is short8, or12 including4 original independent FULL repeats. No budget increase, test waiver or redesigned response campaign is authorized. Do not rerun V1 or the two failed native jobs. Stop this finite recovery after the mandatory artifact/input/reconstruction tests; no extra levels or repeated native trials are needed.

UPDATE — J-Q045-RECOVERY-06 [REPOSITORY]: main was inspected at849f33d54d31c58c58cba37d5134e240987741fe, nontruncated1578-entry tree, no AGENTS.md and no prior V2 target. README/registry/launcher/controller/journal/handoff local V1 blobs match exact installed Git blobs. Reuse pure V1 numerical analysis and scientific contract; remove native worker paths in V2 and narrowly correct derived-YHe validation. New registered target Q045-REFHIST-V2 is prepared for manual installation. V1 registry status becomes COMPLETED_WITH_POSTPROCESSING_FAILURE, which the unchanged launcher blocks. Canonical launcher is byte-identical; README points to offline V2. No remote write or dispatch occurred.

UNCHANGED / UNRESOLVED: REFERENCE_TRUTH_GATE=UNQUALIFIED; FINAL_RESULT_GATE=UNRESOLVED. No global continuum/source/species/event/endpoint/calibration enclosure, no isolated treatment-response result, no TT/TE/EE or native likelihood contrast and no recovered qualified H0/EDE decision margin. The physical hypothesis survives unchanged because a program postprocessing failure is not model failure. Q045 cannot be declared answered from this diagnostic alone. Return exactly once to Result Ingestion & Routing with the actual outputs and inherited blockers; it assesses whether obtainable evidence can materially change the exact question or an honest inconclusive closure belongs at Motor14. No automatic further computation.

# BUBBLEVERSE — Q045 BOUNDED NATIVE HISTORY REFINEMENT V1

DATE AND TIME: 2026-10-10T10:36:39.832774+02:00 (Europe/Copenhagen).
CURRENT Q: Q-045 / Q045 — PROPOSED_CANONICAL_REGISTRATION_PENDING.
CASE ID: NOT DOCUMENTED.
EXACT QUESTION: For the frozen Q041 ΛCDM and n_scf=3 EDE configurations, does replacing only the native optical-depth integration functional with a convergent Thomson-integral reference, at identical requested tau_reio and otherwise unchanged physical inputs, alter CMB TT/TE/EE predictions and native likelihood values enough to threaten the original H0/EDE decision margins?
STATUS: CONTINUES. EXECUTION MODE: reuse native program/observer + bounded numerical diagnostic.
RECOMMENDED CHATGPT SETTING: current Work/Codex; strong reasoning, High if selectable. No account-specific ASTRA MAX availability or current effort level is asserted. A focused capable code/reasoning setup such as GPT-5.6, if available, is a fallback; no model switch or multi-agent work was used.

KEEP: complete incoming 615773-byte journal follows verbatim, SHA256 `cda8486d30a4236de7fd17785ecbc99639f62fbcc3b8968b91b10e7873601919`. All inherited state, Q042/Q044 epistemic closures, Q041 frozen inputs, source IDs/maps, actual successes, failures and model v0.5/R000005 through Q043 remain intact. This differential header governs the new stage; it does not reopen closed cases or replace physical conclusions.

ADD — J-Q045-REFHIST-01 [SOURCE-DOCUMENTED LIMITATION]: pinned CLASS thermodynamics/background use local adaptive tolerances and finite grid spacing. NDF15 accepts/rejects steps using its order-dependent local error estimate; this supplies no exported global continuum history or Thomson-integral enclosure. The V3 stored total-electron histories and spline derivatives support representation diagnostics. Its H/He workspace snapshots can lag source smoothing and are not independently certified species solutions. Missing historical binary compiler information remains NOT DOCUMENTED; reuse of the exact original binary hash avoids inventing build equivalence. Source/history/event/calibration qualifications are not waived.

ADD — J-Q045-REFHIST-02 [PREREGISTERED NUMERICAL DIAGNOSTIC]: PROGRAM_ID Q045-REFHIST-V1 uses the four completed optical V3 histories as L0, and runs exactly eight native background/thermodynamics observations: each original CamSpec/HiLLiPoP LCDM/EDE point at L1 and L2. Physical dictionaries and requested tau_reio remain identical. The nine settings below change only numerical controls; all other effective precision entries are checked against each parent. Original cached CLASS binary/source remain unchanged; only the read-only observer is compiled. This is a bounded reduction of history-accuracy uncertainty, not a declaration that global qualification follows from convergence.

| Numerical control | Existing L0 | L1 | L2 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| tol_thermo_integration | 1e-06 | 5e-07 | 2.5e-07 |
| thermo_integration_stepsize | 0.1 | 0.05 | 0.025 |
| thermo_Nz_lin | 20000 | 40000 | 80000 |
| thermo_Nz_log | 5000 | 10000 | 20000 |
| reionization_sampling | 0.015 | 0.0075 | 0.00375 |
| reionization_optical_depth_tol | 0.0001 | 5e-05 | 2.5e-05 |
| tol_background_integration | 1e-10 | 5e-11 | 2.5e-11 |
| background_integration_stepsize | 0.5 | 0.25 | 0.125 |
| background_Nloga | 40000 | 80000 | 160000 |

ADD — J-Q045-REFHIST-03 [METHOD/SCOPE]: eta-space exact cubic-minus is checked by independent two-point Gauss evaluation. In redshift space, 16/32-point Gauss-Legendre integrate cubic interpolated total xe and linearly interpolated native H in each interval, with integrand nH0·sigma_T·Mpc·xe(z)(1+z)^2/H(z). Native H is 1/Mpc, so no extra c enters. Same-history quadrature differences do not bound unobserved histories or H interpolation. Refined cubic xe/q are projected onto the original L0 redshift grid; accepted scalar depths, z_reio and selected support endpoints are compared. Recalibration and selector drift remain mixed with refinement; they are not isolated history error. Any empirical three-level order/remaining estimate is explicitly EMPIRICAL_NOT_A_BOUND. Even perfect agreement leaves REFERENCE_TRUTH_GATE=UNQUALIFIED and reference_error_bound=null. No source-physics, helium, integrator formula, global arrays, CMB, likelihood, optimizer, sampler or production change is made.

ADD — J-Q045-REFHIST-04 [BUDGET / FINITE STOP]: 8/52 theory slots already consumed (4 FULL baseline starts + 4 component observations). This stage adds at most 8 component observations, giving at most16/52 consumed and at least36 remaining. It does not satisfy eight independent FULL response/reproducibility tests, replace the original treatment matrix or authorize a larger budget. Eight independent 45-minute jobs, maximum4 in parallel, each native process capped900s and output512MiB. No checkpoint is required for these short stateless independent calls. Successful jobs survive failures; missing/duplicate/incompatible jobs cannot merge as complete. No automatic reruns/extra levels/response dispatch. Partial outcomes return to ingestion before recovery consumes any new slot.



[FINITE BUDGET / SPECIFICATION CONFLICT]: the inherited original treatment matrix requires48 FULL evaluations (four points × four treatments × three levels). Only4 FULL L0 native controls already exist; the4 prior telemetry observations and8 new history observations are components, not FULL replacements. Completing that unchanged matrix after this stage would require44 further FULL calls with only36 slots left: a minimum total60 exceeds52 by8. Including the original4 independent FULL repeats yields64, exceeding52 by12. FULL_MATRIX_BUDGET_GATE=FAIL_FOR_UNMODIFIED_48_FULL_PLAN_AFTER_THIS_STAGE. The eight-observation target itself stays within52 and stops as a diagnostic. No response campaign, test waiver, raised cap or narrowed scientific claim is authorized. Ingestion must report this exact terminal specification conflict alongside missing reference/error qualification; no automatic continuation is permitted.

ADD — J-Q045-REFHIST-05 [EXISTING RAW DATA REANALYSIS]: the new analyzer reads all four actual L0 parents (28333 nodes each) without a theory call and verifies their complete member hashes. Below z=30, redshift Gauss32 versus eta exact cubic differs by approximately6.38e-8–6.41e-8 dimensionless depth. Gauss16 versus32 is at most1.39e-17 there. This comparison uses total-xe cubic and linear sampled H, so it is a representation discrepancy, not a global physical-reference error. Unexpected native outputs and interpolation signs are preserved, never clipped. Refined L1/L2 histories and all CMB/likelihood responses remain NOT YET COMPUTED.

UPDATE — J-Q045-REFHIST-06 [REPOSITORY STATE]: current main inspected at2b08781ce57e3b71d7a6de19076db71d9e7702fe, full nontruncated1569-entry tree, no applicable AGENTS.md. No existing refinement target found. Reused executed optical V3 controller helpers and observational C bodies; patched observer metadata/node cap for declared refinement. Canonical launcher remains byte-identical. Registry corrects the V3 nested duplicated Q045- prefix and records its actual completed run38035928310; unrelated entries remain unchanged. New target Q045-REFHIST-V1 is locally registered ACTIVE for manual installation only. README documents current real architecture and V3 completion. No GitHub mutation or dispatch occurred. The package is locally prepared; runtime cache availability and native refined histories remain unverified until execution.

UNRESOLVED: uniform continuum/source/species/event/endpoint/calibration error evidence, admissibility of isolated two-call-site treatments, frozen decision margins, all consumed-observable response and native-likelihood contrasts. Original hypothesis and accepted model status are unchanged. The finite diagnostic cannot by itself close Q045 as a physical YES/NO. Its collector stops and returns the exact qualification blocker plus all eight outcomes to Result Ingestion & Routing. Ingestion determines whether further obtainable material evidence exists or an honest inconclusive closure should go to Motor14; no endless refinement loop is authorized.

# BUBBLEVERSE — Q045 OPTICAL AUDIT V3 RESULT INGESTION

DATE AND TIME: 2026-10-10T10:07:51.443051+02:00 (Europe/Copenhagen).
CURRENT Q: Q-045 / Q045 — PROPOSED_CANONICAL_REGISTRATION_PENDING.
CASE ID: NOT DOCUMENTED.
EXACT QUESTION: For the frozen Q041 ΛCDM and n_scf=3 EDE configurations, does replacing only the native optical-depth integration functional with a convergent Thomson-integral reference, at identical requested tau_reio and otherwise unchanged physical inputs, alter CMB TT/TE/EE predictions and native likelihood values enough to threaten the original H0/EDE decision margins?
STATUS: CONTINUES. Selected next engine: existing Execution-Mechanism / Numerical / HPC / Motor-Builder Engine.

KEEP: the complete incoming 601700-byte journal follows verbatim, SHA256 `2ad3e5771cfe79007fe1717048ba7bfd660c789a4dfb39696933b8a595b61a23`. Every inherited source ID, claim mapping, failure, scientific boundary and Q042/Q044 closure survives. This is a differential update to the same authoritative journal; this header governs the current stage. The unchanged original incoming journal/handoff in the executed final artifact match the supplied attachments byte-for-byte.

ADD — J-Q045-INGEST-V3-01 [TECHNICALLY VALIDATED COMPONENT RESULT]: run 38035928310, attempt1, repository Morfindien/Bubbleverse at `2b08781ce57e3b71d7a6de19076db71d9e7702fe` completed all seven jobs successfully. Final artifact and all four worker archives were downloaded and their official size/SHA256 verified. All expected worker identities, raw-product hashes, original parent hashes, exact physical dictionaries and executed package-manifest files passed ingestion. Collector records no failed/pending worker or error. Completed acquisition now supersedes prospective “V3 telemetry not yet computed” wording, solely at its actual scope.

ADD — J-Q045-INGEST-V3-02 [NATIVE OBSERVATION]: each point has 28333 final nodes, 19 scalar trials (17 bisections), a finite accepted native bracket, and source-produced support/spline data. Each final z/eta/total xe/opacity/exp(-κ)/g column is exactly equal to its original V2 baseline column. q = nH0·sigma_T·Mpc·xe·(1+z)^2 has max relative reconstruction residual 4.39e-16–5.30e-16. This validates decoded normalization at these outputs; it is not continuum/history accuracy. Native tau_reported equals the requested input; actual trial residuals below remain separate. Original source/binary pins are unchanged.

ADD — J-Q045-INGEST-V3-03 [BEREGNET, SAME CUBIC ONLY]: all worker analyses and derived files rederive exactly. Exact-cubic minus and independent two-point Gauss agree within 3.64e-12–2.33e-10 dimensionless depth over the full range. Native original cumulative versus decoded plus differs by at most 3.03e-9. Independently summing the interval curvature discrepancy reproduces the full plus-minus prefix within 2.03e-9. These are observed floating-point comparisons, not a certified continuum or floating-point error bound. The accepted trial scalar discrepancy is about 4.10e-7–4.13e-7. All depth entries in the table are dimensionless.

The exact-real component identity remains Fplus−Fcubic = −sum[(m_i+m_i+1)h_i^3/12], h_i=eta_i+1−eta_i<0, q in Mpc^-1 and m=d²q/deta² in Mpc^-3. The unresolved physical-model error is b=(Fplus−Fcubic)+(Fcubic−R), not the first term alone. No statistical sigma is assigned to deterministic formula differences.

ADD — J-Q045-INGEST-V3-04 [PRESERVED DISCREPANCY, INTERPRETATION LIMITED]: full-table maxima 1.60134–1.60750 occur at z=5000000, native κ≈1.038e6–1.042e6, where recorded exp(-κ)=0. Underflow counts are 11547–11712. Those raw values are preserved; they are not an observable CMB effect or physical anomaly. For z≤1500 the same-history maximum is 2.37930e-5–2.39095e-5; for z≤30 it is 5.74182e-7–5.77744e-7. These are descriptive windows, not prospectively defined scientific pass/fail tolerances. Scalar supports vary across calibration trials, including the N=max(3,argmin) lower branch. Do not use a global smooth derivative through selectors. Workspace species snapshots and the node trapezoid remain non-certified diagnostics. No calibrated reference, changed spectrum or likelihood was evaluated.

UPDATE — J-Q045-INGEST-V3-05 [EXECUTION STATE]: baseline4 + telemetry4 = 8/52 consumed; ingestion starts0, at most44 slots remain. V3 acquisition is complete and must not be relaunched unchanged. The prior V1/V2 environmental/path failures remain HISTORICAL, not physical falsifications. Repository README/registry were read-only evidence; no remote change/dispatch was made during ingestion. Prepared registry ACTIVE wording is historical execution preparation, not scientific permission to repeat. [CORRECTED] the inherited handoff typo Q045-Q045-OPTICAL-AUDIT-V3 is not an identifier; canonical executed PROGRAM_ID is Q045-OPTICAL-AUDIT-V3.

UNRESOLVED — J-Q045-INGEST-V3-06 [PHYSICAL ANSWER]: REFERENCE_TRUTH_GATE=UNQUALIFIED; FINAL_RESULT_GATE=UNRESOLVED. Component tests are complete but physical history/event/endpoint/calibration remainder, reference recalibration, TT/TE/EE/all consumed observables, native likelihood response, original qualified inference margins and whole-domain coverage remain absent. Therefore Q045 cannot close as YES, NO or model falsification. It remains materially unresolved because a finite reference qualification and response acquisition may change its answer. No accepted model, H0 estimate, posterior or portability result is promoted. H0 entries remain frozen inputs.

## Exact next task and stopping rules

Recover the named numerical controls and event/support semantics from the acquired effective_precision.tsv, exact source and traces. Make the existing J-045-09 reference-qualification stage concrete: freeze baseline/half/quarter accuracy settings and an independent eta/redshift Thomson integration, then justify a physical history/interpolation/event/endpoint/calibration error enclosure. Reuse the four completed native inputs and raw histories. Do not repeat V3 or repair unrelated physics.

Before new computation, resolve exact original-binary/compiler reproducibility and species/history validity prerequisites; qualify each rather than assuming a workspace snapshot is an independent species solution. Missing historical compiler information remains a documented limitation; a new build must not be declared identical by assumption. Establish whether the isolated two-call-site intervention is valid without solver/source-physics repairs.

Allocate any necessary new histories prospectively within the 44 remaining theory slots. The original 48-treatment/three-level plan plus independent FULL repeats cannot simply be launched in addition to telemetry: these four telemetry runs are background/thermodynamics observations, not independent FULL CMB/likelihood repeats. Document reuse and mandatory tests, or report a finite budget/specification conflict; do not raise 52 or waive a test silently. Unqualified continuum remainder is a terminal prerequisite for that bounded stage, not permission to dispatch counterfactuals.

Only after reference qualification may a separately documented finite 00/10/01/11 response target be proposed with exact consumed-observable/native-likelihood coverage and unchanged inputs. No new target, PROGRAM_ID, remote dispatch, spectrum/likelihood execution, optimizer, sampler or production is authorized or created by this ingestion. Return qualification evidence or the exact blocker to Result Ingestion & Routing Engine. Actual original decision margins remain missing; no substitute spectral-percent tolerance or fixed-start likelihood gap may replace them.

SUCCESS: demonstrate a defensible physical reference/error enclosure on the exact domain with frozen numerical controls, valid histories/supports, preserved native control, reproducible identities and explicit budget; or document an exact terminal blocker with evidence. Neither outcome automatically answers decision-margin materiality.
FAILURE: missing/invalid identity/history/source support, nonfinite bracket, inadmissible reference, unqualified history/event/calibration remainder or irreconcilable mandatory-test/budget conflict stops that stage with the original raw evidence. This is technical/reference failure, not physical falsification.
STOP: stop this ingestion now; no further repetition of acquired V3 is needed. Next bounded stage returns once qualification passes or a specific prerequisite fails. Close Q045 and route to MOTOR14 only when the exact question has a defensible scoped answer and no obtainable material uncertainty can reasonably reverse it; an honest inconclusive closure is allowed if the terminal blocker exhausts the credible finite path. Current closure is not asserted.

# BUBBLEVERSE — Q045 OPTICAL AUDIT V3 INSTALLATION-PATH REPAIR

DATE AND TIME: 2026-10-10T08:36:36.753322+02:00 (Europe/Copenhagen).
CURRENT Q: Q-045 / Q045 — PROPOSED_CANONICAL_REGISTRATION_PENDING.
CASE ID: NOT DOCUMENTED.
EXACT QUESTION: For the frozen Q041 ΛCDM and n_scf=3 EDE configurations, does replacing only the native optical-depth integration functional with a convergent Thomson-integral reference, at identical requested tau_reio and otherwise unchanged physical inputs, alter CMB TT/TE/EE predictions and native likelihood values enough to threaten the original H0/EDE decision margins?
PROGRAM_ID: Q045-OPTICAL-AUDIT-V3. STATUS: CONTINUES.

KEEP: complete previous journal follows verbatim (597695 bytes, SHA256 `8ac73814394f9df228817288cf14b4a694c8f01851ae08a862536f3133bab4f8`). All previous source IDs, claim maps, baseline values, failures and Q042/Q044 closures survive. This header differentially updates the same authoritative journal.

ADD — J-Q045-PATH-01 [TECHNICAL FAILURE]: optical audit V2 run38030968453, attempt1, commit `0124316bfb88629bcccd9b18a5cef448ade309ed` passed static/input recovery and restored the exact original cache in all four workers. Its finite-test step then failed because the cache regression test read the workflow from repository root, while the installed workflow exists at `.github/workflows/q045-optical-audit-v2.yml`. All four native observation steps were skipped. Zero theory evaluations started in optical V1 or V2; the inherited budget remains4/52 consumed. The inspected CamSpec-EDE worker's native-array synthetic fixture passed, but this is not an original cosmological binary observation.

ADD — J-Q045-PATH-02 [CORRECTION]: V3 changes the test's workflow path to its canonical `.github/workflows/` location. Local validation stages the exact installed file map with no root YAML duplicate. Reproducing that layout exposed the old failure before correction. The production controller changes only optical target/file version names; the C observer is byte-identical to V2. The successful original nine-path cache identity, CLASS source/binary pins, physical dictionaries, precision, methods, data/likelihood/prior, four-worker limit and numerical gates remain unchanged. No substitute binary, rebuild or scientific tolerance is introduced.

UPDATE: V2 is FAILED/inactive in the prepared registry, carrying actual run/commit and zero started evaluations; V3 is the new ACTIVE target. Other registry entries and the permanent launcher are unchanged. README describes the current target and retains V1/V2 failures. Earlier local preparation PASS did not establish installed-layout validity and is corrected for that limitation, without erasing its historical test evidence.

ADD — I-Q045-OPTICAL-AUDIT-RUN-V2-001 [INTERNAL TECHNICAL EVIDENCE]: https://github.com/Morfindien/Bubbleverse/actions/runs/38030968453; official jobs/artifact metadata and CamSpec-EDE worker log, retrieved 2026-10-10T08:36:36.753322+02:00; preserved in `Q045_OPTICAL_AUDIT_V2_FAILURE.json`. Artifact inner files are not claimed as retrieved. I-Q045-PATH-REPAIR-001: this V3 code/contract/manifest and red/green installed-layout validation. Claim map: J-Q045-PATH-01→I-Q045-OPTICAL-AUDIT-RUN-V2-001; -02→I-Q045-PATH-REPAIR-001 plus frozen source/method IDs already in this journal.

UNRESOLVED: new original-binary telemetry, qualified physical continuum reference, response in CMB/likelihood and actual original inference margins. FINAL_RESULT_GATE=UNRESOLVED; REFERENCE_TRUTH_GATE=UNQUALIFIED. No model is physically falsified or promoted. Scientific results are NOT YET COMPUTED.

NEXT: one V3 launch, four bounded independent outcomes, then existing Result Ingestion & Routing Engine with complete Q/journal/source/provenance state. No automatic reruns, treatments, samplers or production continuation. Actual V3 GitHub installation/execution is not performed by assistant.

# BUBBLEVERSE — Q045 OPTICAL AUDIT V2 CACHE REPAIR

DATE AND TIME: 2026-10-10T07:16:28.480315+02:00 (Europe/Copenhagen).
CURRENT Q: Q-045 / Q045 — PROPOSED_CANONICAL_REGISTRATION_PENDING.
CASE ID: NOT DOCUMENTED.
EXACT QUESTION: For the frozen Q041 ΛCDM and n_scf=3 EDE configurations, does replacing only the native optical-depth integration functional with a convergent Thomson-integral reference, at identical requested tau_reio and otherwise unchanged physical inputs, alter CMB TT/TE/EE predictions and native likelihood values enough to threaten the original H0/EDE decision margins?
PROGRAM_ID: Q045-OPTICAL-AUDIT-V2.
STATUS: CONTINUES; locally checked repair prepared, remote installation and execution not performed by assistant.

KEEP: the complete prior authoritative journal follows verbatim (592961 bytes; SHA256 `1e9fefdaa4c528501cd24994f2ff8f9596af927d0de7d5f3673cb7a98934fb36`). Every inherited source ID, claim map, failed hypothesis, Q042/Q044 closure, frozen scientific input and baseline result survives. This differential header updates the same journal.

ADD — J-Q045-CACHE-01 [TECHNICAL FAILURE]: optical audit V1 run38026287784, attempt1, commit `e4a4c1061ae84d5bb638afaa2d0902004d779dcb` passed static and baseline-input recovery. All four audit jobs failed at cache acquisition; their original-binary observation steps were skipped. The collector failed its completeness requirement and preserved the final artifact. Zero new theory evaluations started, supported by official job-step records. Four original V2 native baseline evaluations remain consumed out of52; the four telemetry slots remain available. No physical answer, parameter preference or anomaly was produced.

ADD — J-Q045-CACHE-02 [DOCUMENTED DIAGNOSIS]: V1 used the correct original key but replaced its nine-path cache list with only `external/class_ede`. GitHub matches the cache version as well as key; the path metadata contributes to that version. This explains why V1 cannot select the previously used nine-path version. Current cache retention/availability is not independently established. The Node punycode warning is preserved; it is not the failing prerequisite.

UPDATE — J-Q045-CACHE-03 [MINIMAL REPAIR]: V2 restores the exact original nine paths, order, key and cache action from the successful baseline workflow. `fail-on-cache-miss:true`, no restore keys, no cache save, no rebuild and exact CLASS source/binary hashes remain enforced. The native observer C is byte-identical to V1; controller changes only target/file version names. Numerical methods, input dictionaries, precision, likelihoods, data, priors, limits and physical gates are unchanged. Ten Python tests now include a regression for the original complete cache identity.

SUPERSEDE: V1 is retained as FAILED in the prepared registry, with actual run/commit and zero started evaluations. V2 is the new active target; all other registry entries survive exactly. The permanent launcher is unchanged. README current-target references move to V2 and preserve the failed V1 record.

ADD — I-Q045-OPTICAL-AUDIT-RUN-V1-001 [INTERNAL TECHNICAL EVIDENCE]: https://github.com/Morfindien/Bubbleverse/actions/runs/38026287784; official jobs/artifact metadata and worker/collector logs, retrieved 2026-10-10T07:16:28.480315+02:00; summarized with original excerpts in `Q045_OPTICAL_AUDIT_V1_FAILURE.json`. Raw artifact inner contents were not downloaded during this repair; no claim is invented from their filenames.

ADD — I-Q045-CACHE-VERSION-001 [OFFICIAL TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION]: GitHub, Dependency caching reference, https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/dependency-caching, retrieved 2026-10-10T07:16:28.480315+02:00; cache matching includes key/version, with path/compression metadata in the version. Claim map: J-Q045-CACHE-01→I-Q045-OPTICAL-AUDIT-RUN-V1-001; -02→I-Q045-CACHE-VERSION-001,I-Q045-OPTICAL-AUDIT-RUN-V1-001; -03→the frozen V2 baseline workflow at `e4a4c1061ae84d5bb638afaa2d0902004d779dcb`, this V2 package/tests/manifest.

UNRESOLVED: original-binary remote observation, physical continuum reference qualification, CMB/likelihood response and original inference margins. FINAL_RESULT_GATE=UNRESOLVED; REFERENCE_TRUTH_GATE=UNQUALIFIED. Successful cache recovery alone resolves no physical claim. A corrected lookup that still misses must stop before computation and preserve its evidence, not build a substitute binary.

RETURN ROUTE: existing Result Ingestion & Routing Engine after the four bounded outcomes or failed prerequisites. No automatic treatment, repeated campaign, posterior, source repair or production restart.

## Differential journal actions

KEEP: all incoming scientific state, source IDs, maps, numerical values, technical failures and warnings. The complete 586654-byte incoming journal (SHA256 `a02f72a9b9354e29eef3000db5344fce95bcd817637b945a8adf30d3ef77ac81`) follows verbatim. This header is a differential update to the same authoritative journal; it is not a new or competing journal.

UPDATE: V2 baseline run38023210800 is complete (four diagnostic points), while its remote README still said full runtime validation was pending. The prepared README/registry now record that actual completion and make V2 inactive against redundant relaunch. All other registry entries survive exactly.

ADD — J-Q045-OPTICAL-AUDIT-01 [TECHNICAL PREPARATION]: inspect exact scalar trials and raw cumulative kappa through read-only symbol observers linked to the unchanged original diagnostic classy binary. Reuse the existing Q042 V24 linking method, never the V24 scientific point or Q042 repair task. Fixed physical input dictionaries are copied from the four verified V2 manifests; sampled vectors/nuisances remain connected to those original baseline records. No new motor, physical input, source patch, accuracy override, dataset, prior, optimizer or posterior is introduced.

ADD — J-Q045-OPTICAL-AUDIT-02 [PREREGISTERED METHOD]: record every actual scalar support, source-produced spline second derivatives, trial z_reio/tau/endpoint, native accepted bracket replay, effective precision/default paths/constants, source species workspace snapshots, raw cumulative kappa before exponentiation, and final total-x_e/opacity/background tables. Require exact equality of decoded final native columns against V2. Workspace H/He are snapshots after source returns; smoothing may leave them at the previous-regime evaluation and parametric reionization modifies the total separately. They are not independent fully qualified species histories. Preserve both workspace and actually stored total x_e instead of imposing equality between different physical conventions.

ADD — J-Q045-OPTICAL-AUDIT-03 [MATHEMATICAL COMPONENT]: native-plus and exact-cubic-minus use identical emitted eta/opacity/second derivatives; independent two-node Gauss evaluation checks the same cubic integral. A redshift-space node trapezoid uses the fork's nH0, sigma, Mpc and native H in1/Mpc; no c is inserted twice. The coordinate reconstruction and shared history dependence stay explicit. Neither comparison establishes a converged physical Thomson reference, a continuum remainder, a response in CMB/likelihood, or an original decision margin.

UNRESOLVED: original binary compiler provenance, full historical campaign equivalence, physical species/history/event validity, independently qualified continuum error, prospective matched three-level reference accuracy, all required new response observables and actual inference margins. FINAL_RESULT_GATE remains UNRESOLVED. Actual new telemetry/numerical response is NOT YET COMPUTED. No physical hypothesis is falsified or promoted.

ADD — J-Q045-OPTICAL-AUDIT-04 [FINITE EXECUTION]: exactly four original-background/thermodynamics observations maximum, one per fixed input. Reserve four conservative theory-evaluation slots in the existing52 total; four native baselines are already complete. At most8 slots consumed after this target; at most44 remain for any separately justified work. No count reset, automatic retry, new point, fourth refinement, source repair or historical sampler resume. These are new telemetry evaluations, not full CMB/likelihood reproducibility runs. Runtime attempts/failures consume their started slots; unstarted jobs do not. The first failed prerequisite stops its worker, preserves raw logs, and returns the failure. Valid independent workers remain preserved.

ADD — I-Q045-OPTICAL-AUDIT-DESIGN-001 [INTERNAL TECHNICAL EVIDENCE]: this prepared contract/code/manifest/test record; inspection head `175a657490c2a04bbbd8e1b3e4a3c3fbbc499f72`. Primary method sources remain K-Q042-INGESTDESIGN-001 (pinned arrays.c), K-Q042-V24-001/K-Q042-DESIGN-001 (pinned thermodynamics.c), I-Q045-WORKERS-V2-001 and I-Q045-RUN-V2-001. New implementation reference: repository `q042_class_origin_probe_v24.c` / `q042_class_origin_v24.py` at the inspection head. These supply a previously executed observation architecture, not an independent scientific reference.

# COMPLETE INCOMING AUTHORITATIVE JOURNAL — UNCHANGED BYTES FOLLOW

# BUBBLEVERSE — RESULT INGESTION & ROUTING HANDOFF

STATUS: CONTINUES.
CASE ID: NOT DOCUMENTED.
CURRENT Q: Q-045 / Q045 — PROPOSED; canonical scientific registration pending.
QUESTION: For the frozen Q041 ΛCDM and n_scf=3 EDE configurations, does replacing only the native optical-depth integration functional with a convergent Thomson-integral reference, at identical requested tau_reio and otherwise unchanged physical inputs, alter CMB TT/TE/EE predictions and native likelihood values enough to threaten the original H0/EDE decision margins?
DATE AND TIME: 2026-10-10T06:30:30.109873+02:00 (Europe/Copenhagen; runtime clock).
RESULT ID: R-Q045-NATIVE-BASELINE-INGESTION-001.
SELECTED NEXT ENGINE: BUBBLEVERSE — AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION-MECHANISM / NUMERICAL / HPC / MOTOR-BUILDER ENGINE.
Q-COMPLETION GATE: NOT YET SATISFIED.
FINAL_RESULT_GATE: UNRESOLVED.

## RECOMMENDED CHATGPT EXECUTION PROFILE

AVAILABLE CONFIGURATIONS CONSIDERED: current Work/Codex with code/files, GitHub reads/artifact retrieval and web/primary-source access. The exposed agent catalogue includes GPT-6.1 Sol, GPT-6 Astra, GPT-6 Sol, GPT-5.6 Sol and GPT-6 Luna, but this does not establish the operator's model menu or comparative scientific reliability. No model switch or agent delegation occurred.
RECOMMENDED MODEL / MODE: current Work/Codex with a strong reasoning configuration.
RECOMMENDED REASONING LEVEL: High or deeper if selectable; exact active effort is not independently verified.
RECOMMENDED EXECUTION STYLE: bounded autonomous source/code/numerical work; capability classes C + E in this ingestion engine's catalogue.
WHY: full journal continuity and a narrowly defined two-call-site numerical reference need careful provenance and real code execution. A maximum-mode research campaign is unnecessary for parsing these successful raw baselines.
RECOMMENDED PLUGINS / TOOLS: read-only GitHub for pinned methods/artifacts; local Python for raw integrity and reference calculations; persistent individual-file delivery.
OPTIONAL CAPABILITIES: primary literature/source lookup only for missing reference/error definitions. No browser, broad literature search, plugin installation, images, deployment or parallel agents are needed now.
FALLBACK: another strong reasoning setup with equivalent file/repository/computation tools; GPT-5.6 if available and sufficient.
UPGRADE: only if switched-event reference/error enclosure or coupled calibration/transport implementation exceeds the current setup's reliable capacity.
CAPABILITY LIMITATIONS: account model menu, exact context/usage limits and allocated HPC are not verified. More reasoning cannot supply missing physical/inference products.

## SAMLET JOURNAL — CURRENT EFFECTIVE UPDATE

KEEP all 568275 incoming journal bytes, including the complete 91-object inherited source register, the inherited claim-map trees, all Q/source IDs and scientific/technical failures. Incoming SHA256 `aec2dd628f61197a2b06f732fe39ad8be09c374e43b1f632c3c0c6644757f4cc`. They follow this differential update verbatim. The current supplied journal identity is preserved; no parallel scientific journal is created. Historical preparation/launch instructions below are superseded for the completed V2 acquisition.

KEEP Q042 and Q044 closed inconclusive; KEEP Q045 proposed/open; KEEP the accepted-model boundary only as inherited, not freshly verified or promoted. No main question, source pin, physical model or original scientific decision rule changes.

ADD [BUBBLEVERSE NUMERICAL / TECHNICAL RESULT] Run `38023210800`, attempt 1, workflow `.github/workflows/q045-native-baseline-v2.yml`, execution commit `175a657490c2a04bbbd8e1b3e4a3c3fbbc499f72`, completed successfully. All seven jobs succeeded. The four native FULL diagnostic starts completed with process return code 0 and no worker errors. Job completeness and merge compatibility PASS; baseline gate PASS_NATIVE_DIAGNOSTIC_ONLY. The received final archive matches official artifact `11659125612` digest `d1a236bbf4d0660e7b3d38f13aff1a2aa8f3f330d45ddc3b51072edaaa428e97`. Contract SHA256 `d1855120a2746e1b3838aa422cfe41cfd980f340301ea5c0fa6612b0cd29e6b8`. Attached handoff/journal equal their archived copies.

| Native FULL diagnostic | log likelihood sum | H0 input (km/s/Mpc) | Requested tau | Worker wall time (s) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| camspec-lcdm | -1590.008076 | 68.165994 | 0.05141852 | 35.103 |
| camspec-ede_n3 | -1283.825249 | 68.165994 | 0.05141852 | 61.641 |
| hillipop-lcdm | -1692.644369 | 68.711122 | 0.05150685 | 34.828 |
| hillipop-ede_n3 | -1248.049955 | 68.711122 | 0.05150685 | 48.079 |

These H0/tau values are fixed diagnostic INPUTS, not new fitted estimates or measurements. Likelihoods include the unchanged shape/penalty components recorded by the original builders; no cross-arm absolute subtraction, evidence comparison, model ranking or optimized DeltaChi2 is inferred. Full machine precision and component/prior/posterior separation are preserved in the raw JSONs.

STRENGTHEN [TECHNICAL USABILITY] All four downloaded worker archives match their official SHA256 digests; every original file hash matches its worker record. The final/worker Q, run, contract and execution identities agree. All workers report the pinned original diagnostic CLASS binary `df1e81831dae7e88b651342a3d72de7597cf2b1145586035c6226715dbca04cf`, Python 3.11.16, all ten package versions, identical external source pins, the same complete 175-file cached-data snapshot and the same external signature. Native likelihood sums match component sums; posterior accounting agrees within <=2.3e-13. All three tables are finite and correctly shaped: 9,002 TT/TE/EE rows (ell 0..9001), 28,333 thermodynamics rows and 40,000 background rows. This is role-limited validation, not independent physical-history or full historical-parent qualification.

UPDATE [KNOWN GOOD TECHNICAL PATH] The flit_core 3.12.0 repair is now demonstrated in the actual Python 3.11.16 GitHub execution. V1's environment failure remains historical. No baseline repeat is needed merely to show that the installation works.

ADD [REPRESENTATION LIMITATION; RAW OUTPUT PRESERVED] Thermodynamics contains native total x_e, opacity, exp(-kappa) and visibility. Depending on the worker, 11,547–11,712 exp(-kappa) entries are exactly zero. At those rows raw g equals DBL_MIN=2.2250738585072014e-308, matching the pinned source's explicit zero-visibility guard. This explains the tiny absolute residual in g versus opacity*exp(-kappa); it is not a new scientific anomaly or a reason to delete the rows. The exported exponent does not preserve the pre-exponentiation kappa at those rows. A -log inversion would not recover that missing curve. Requested tau is present; calibrated z_reio, accepted bracket/residual, scalar-specific spline derivatives and direct raw kappa are not explicitly recorded in this package.

UNRESOLVED [SCIENTIFIC ANSWER] No 10/01/11 intervention, independently qualified Thomson reference, refinement/remainder bound, calibrated spectrum/native-likelihood contrast, actual original decision-margin transport or full-domain inference envelope was produced. Native total x_e is not an independently qualified species history. Original campaign-binary equivalence and independently missing parent-data qualification remain exactly as documented. The finite values do not repair or refute the historical failing V29 point; these are different frozen input vectors.

PRESERVE warnings: legacy SACC FITS ordering assumption and ACT lensing's Hartlap correction 0.9860935524652339. They are original raw execution details, not new data choices; they are not independently qualified by this ingestion. No undocumented warning is silently waived into a physical final PASS.

SELECT exactly one next engine: the existing Execution-Mechanism / Numerical / HPC / Motor-Builder Engine. The bottleneck is now actual reference-stage execution and missing internal quantities, not another proof of the already established integration formula. The repository's scoped motor file is historical Q042 context; its helium-repair instructions must not be imported into Q045. The operator's existing engine and J-045-09 finite optical-depth specification govern this handoff.

NEXT TASK: Finish the already specified isolated Thomson-reference acquisition, reusing the verified native 00 baselines; first recover exact scalar-calibration support/spline/bracket and pre-exponentiation cumulative depth, then qualify same-history reference error before any 10/01/11 coupled history/spectrum/native-likelihood evaluation.

## NEXT TASK — FROZEN SCOPE AND FINITE STOP

1. Reuse these exact four 00 outputs and their immutable input vectors as the native diagnostic controls. Inspect recoverability from these stored products before scheduling anything. Do not repeat V2 wholesale or refit starts.
2. Recover the scalar-calibration-specific table/eta nodes, selected first-minimum index and actual endpoint, spline boundary conditions/second derivatives, requested/reported/independently realized tau, z_reio and accepted calibration bracket/residual. Recover cumulative kappa BEFORE exponentiation, its full-table spline derivatives, and every additional observable consumed by the frozen likelihoods (including lensing). Export effective default precision/helium/constants/build identities where not already recorded. Use minimal observation-only instrumentation if exact quantities cannot be reconstructed; do not guess or merge a helium/branch repair into this experiment.
3. Freeze units and source-derived normalization; H is in 1/Mpc in the export, conformal time is a length in Mpc, opacity is in 1/Mpc, and x_e is electrons per H nucleus. Derive reference n_e and c conversions from the actual fork. Compare native plus, exact-spline minus and independently integrated Thomson depth on IDENTICAL history/support; cross-check eta and z formulations. A same-grid minus correction is a control, not by itself a converged physical-model reference.
4. Make the already specified J-045-09 reference stage executable only with a defensible interpolation/history/quadrature/calibration error account. Freeze the three accuracy levels and event/support handling before new treatment output. If qualification cannot be defended, stop this stage with the exact UNQUALIFIED/BLOCKED reason; do not choose a tolerance to make it pass.
5. If that gate passes, carry out the existing isolated treatments 10 (reference scalar only), 01 (reference cumulative only), 11 (both), with matched native controls where a new build/refinement makes them necessary. Change only the authorized optical-depth call sites, preserve all physical inputs, native likelihoods/nuisances and requested tau. Preserve the original binary/control. The unchanged initial maximum is 52 theory evaluations across the entire preregistered diagnostic acquisition; four original 00 evaluations are now completed. Count instrumented controls/refinements/repeats in that ledger rather than restarting its budget. No arbitrary fourth refinement, automatic rerun, additional point or old sampler checkpoint resume.
6. Report signed same-history scalar/cumulative biases, support/endpoint terms, calibration changes, absolute TT/TE/EE and consumed-observable changes, exact within-arm native likelihood contrasts and factorial interaction, with qualified uncertainty or explicit failed reference gate. Avoid dividing by TE near zero. Recover actual original decision margins only from qualified existing products; do not fabricate a replacement margin or launch inference to create one. Fixed-point sensitivity alone is not a changed posterior/best-fit preference.
7. Return the complete current journal, source IDs, all raw products, build/patch/config/data/binary identities, the exact qualification/response scope and finite stop result to Result Ingestion & Routing. If no remaining obtainable material evidence can change the warranted answer, ingestion closes Q045 epistemically and routes directly to Motor14.

SUCCESS: A same-definition reference with defensible uncertainty and qualified finite response, or a precise documented terminal prerequisite blocker. Acquisition success does not automatically establish inference materiality.
FAILURE: Missing source/identity/observable, invalid history, unsupported reference or nonfinite bracket -> preserve the raw evidence and stop that acquisition branch. Technical failure is not physical falsification.
STOP: Do not repeat successful baseline acquisition or old component proofs. End at the first terminal reference/identity failure, the inherited finite evaluation limit, or a defensible answer to the exact Q. If further obtainable work has no realistic material-reversal value, close Q045 with its honest warranted scope and route directly to Motor14. Report Writer is excluded.
PRODUCTION_RESTART_AUTHORIZED=false. No sampler, optimizer, remote mutation, new PROGRAM_ID or dispatch is performed by this ingestion.

## CLAIM-TO-SOURCE MAP — NEW DIFFERENTIAL ENTRIES

- **C-Q045-I01**: All four native diagnostics completed; no failed/pending workers; native-only completeness/merge pass → I-Q045-FINAL-V2-001, I-Q045-WORKERS-V2-001, I-Q045-RUN-V2-001

- **C-Q045-I03**: H0 and requested tau are fixed start inputs; likelihoods are unoptimized values and are not a posterior/model-preference conclusion → I-Q045-WORKERS-V2-001, I-Q045-CODE-V2-001, I-Q044-CONTRACT-001
- **C-Q045-I04**: No isolated optical-depth contrast, qualified reference or actual decision-margin transport has been computed → I-Q045-FINAL-V2-001, I-Q045-CODE-V2-001, I-Q045-MATH-OPTICAL-TRANSPORT-001
- **C-Q045-I05**: exp(-kappa) has exact zero rows; pre-exponentiation native kappa cannot be recovered there by logarithm; g floor at these rows agrees with the pinned DBL_MIN guard → I-Q045-WORKERS-V2-001, I-Q045-PRODUCT-AUDIT-001, K-Q042-V24-001, K-Q042-DESIGN-001
- **C-Q045-I06**: The sole next destination is the established execution engine for the finite reference stage, preserving Q045 rather than resurrecting historical Q042 treatment instructions → I-Q045-ARCHITECTURE-001, I-Q045-MATH-OPTICAL-TRANSPORT-001, I-Q045-WORKERS-V2-001

## CHATGPT-SETUPVURDERING

Recommended: current Work/Codex with repository reads, local code execution and strong reasoning; High if selectable. Capability classes C/A + H. This is a contained installation repair. GPT-5.6 with equivalent tools is a suitable fallback if available; ASTRA MAX menu availability is not verified. No model switch is necessary. Upgrade only if a later failure requires substantial scientific or numerical reconstruction.

## Differential journal update

KEEP the full previous authoritative journal verbatim below, including Q, scientific question, sources/source IDs, constraints, results, failures and unresolved scientific qualifications. Prior journal SHA256: `03006221b8d73a0f8d0e51a133e733d8b7a61fea6ef8a180f1c8149c510ab298`. Historical instructions below are superseded by this current action; no journal is rebuilt.

ADD [BUBBLEVERSE TECHNICAL EVIDENCE] Read-only repository inspection at `7b5047dd9eafbd7986c15514ec3534e2b0ed3bc3`. V1 was installed by the operator. Run #2, ID `38021982095`, failed: static and original-input recovery passed; all four baseline jobs failed in interface setup; their native evaluation steps were skipped. All four logs contain `Cannot import 'flit_core.buildapi'` after obtaining `external/act_dr6_lenslike`. Collector failed completeness. Reported CamSpec/EDE job: `114124874775`; other jobs: `114124874735`, `114124874759`, `114124874765`. Run #1 also reports failure, but its cause was not inspected in this repair.

FAILED: Q045 V1 editable ACT lensing installation with `--no-build-isolation` and no flit_core dependency.
CAUSE: At frozen ACT lensing commit `b386ddbb5821c1216c709f051c9289292f174d30`, `pyproject.toml` declares `flit_core >=3.2,<4` and backend `flit_core.buildapi`. Disabling build isolation makes the caller responsible for supplying it. V1's requirements omitted it. The earlier Q041 setup allowed pip build isolation; V1 introduced the omission by disabling it.
FIX: Add exactly `flit_core==3.12.0`, retaining all nine scientific package pins; import/version/PEP660 gate before editable installations. CLASS, model, likelihood definitions, physical inputs, source commits, data and precision are unchanged.
KNOWN GOOD (LOCAL BUILD MECHANISM ONLY): The same backend failure was reproduced in a clean local Python 3.12.14 environment; installing only flit_core 3.12.0 enabled editable installation of the frozen ACT lensing source subset (metadata/module files retrieved directly at its commit). Actual V2 backend preflight passed. Wheel SHA256: `e7a0304069ea895172e3c7bb703292e992c5d1555dd1233ab7b5621b5b69e62c`. This is not a full likelihood/data test; GitHub remains Python 3.11.16 and its complete restored environment must still pass all gates.

SUPERSEDE the executable V1 target with Q045-BASELINE-V2 in the prepared registry; V1 status becomes SUPERSEDED and is rejected by the unchanged launcher. Preserve V1 files, run and artifacts as technical history. Other registry entries are unchanged. README's current target and failure boundary are updated differentially.

KEEP all scientific boundaries: Q042/Q044 closed inconclusive; Q045 proposed; four native FULL start-index-0 diagnostic points only; no reference treatments, optimization, posterior inference, production restart or model promotion. All acquired outputs remain RAW_NOT_QUALIFIED and FINAL_RESULT_GATE remains UNRESOLVED. No hypothesis was tested by the failed setup.

NEXT REQUIRED ACTION: Upload the complete V2 files at their stated paths, replace the canonical registry/README/journal/handoff, and launch only Q045-BASELINE-V2 through 🚀 BUBBLEVERSE START. Return the final JSON and worker artifacts to ingestion, including any newly failed gate. The assistant has neither modified GitHub nor dispatched this target.

## CHATGPT-SETUPVURDERING

Primary: current Work/Codex with strong reasoning, code/files and authenticated read-only repository access. High reasoning if operator-selectable; exact active variant/effort and Astra Max menu availability are not independently verified. Capability classes C/A + H. The immediate work is a bounded code adaptation and integrity review; a frontier long-horizon campaign is unnecessary. GPT-5.6 is a suitable fallback if available with equivalent tools. Upgrade only for difficult independent reference/error qualification or a genuinely larger inference task. No model switch or delegation occurred.

## Differential journal update

KEEP the complete incoming authoritative journal, all Q/source IDs, failures, tested boundaries and accepted-model history. Incoming bytes: 556043; SHA256 `8f76d796d24cb9ac92c1ea9d62dee18914aa3a659bd15669c78b9e44149c5002`. Those exact bytes follow this section unchanged. This is the same authoritative journal identity, not a second journal.

KEEP Q044 closed epistemically inconclusive and Q042 closed inconclusive. KEEP Q045 proposed and its exact scientific question from I-Q045-MATH-OPTICAL-TRANSPORT-001. No scientific Q is created by the technical baseline stage. KEEP the inherited accepted remote boundary v0.5/R000005 through Q043; no promotion or remote synchronization is performed.

ADD [TECHNICAL EVIDENCE] Read-only inspection of `Morfindien/Bubbleverse` main at `72cf9e92fc794c122f593a77b6a555e6e97f6a2e`, recursive tree nontruncated: existing canonical launcher and registry exist; no Q045 target existed. Q041/Q042 model builders and production start rule are reused, with their file hashes frozen in the new contract. README's stale Q042-open/current-V29 front section is corrected in the prepared snapshot. Existing launcher is unchanged; Q042 V29 becomes COMPLETED in the prepared registry. Other registry entries remain as inspected.

ADD [TECHNICAL EVIDENCE] Original Q032 final artifact 9980784387 from run 33994305721 was retrieved and checked: 13161 bytes, SHA256 `dd7b069337aeee660d1c46158f78d9a81d6a0115309f6b333e8555899308d692`. It recovers CamSpec M6-S0 and HiLLiPoP M6-S2 parent records; these are seeds, not Q045 minima. No new observational evidence is inferred from retrieving them.

ADD [TECHNICAL EVIDENCE] Frozen original Q042 V1 environment artifact 10862038917, run 36133813540, head `6c44a4117449145afd0a3ae6eb238490686a8c6d`, was retrieved locally and its 278412344-byte digest verified: `162b99026d025d1021fa8a83dbf4290b7bd0c2c53917ea56cbf04f8b169bff4a`. It preserves all 18 original Q032 refinement record files, sealed preflight, full/reduced precision matrices and supports, original specification/source lock, frozen SN manifest and runtime metadata. Individual hashes of all 29 archived files are frozen in the Q045 contract. The workflow uses this acquisition source directly. Archive transport is internal; no archive is delivered to the operator.

ADD [EXECUTION DECISION] Existing numerical/HPC execution engine plus a small conventional controller is sufficient. The full 52-evaluation scalar/cumulative factorial proposal is not yet runnable responsibly. First acquire four unmodified native FULL baseline diagnostics at start index 0, via the unchanged original builders and start algorithm. The start algorithm already clips uniform-prior coordinates 5 percent inside bounds; raw Q032 parent values must not overwrite those resulting starts. Full sampled vector, fixed/derived/likelihood definitions and effective CLASS parameters are retained at runtime.

ADD [PROGRAM PREPARED] Q045-BASELINE-V1 has static, input-acquisition, four independent worker and collection jobs (seven jobs total, at most four numerical workers concurrently). Exact-key cache restore only. Pinned Python interface installation/backport is allowed; CLASS source/binary changes and missing-data downloads are forbidden. Native process cap 1200 seconds, worker job timeout 80 minutes. Caps are not runtime predictions. No checkpoint is needed for one atomic fixed-point evaluation. Failed jobs and completed independent jobs remain visible; no automatic retry or downstream dispatch occurs.

ADD [TEST PLAN] T001 package/Q/registry/launcher/README/journal; T002 original input/source/software/backend identity; T003 one finite native likelihood per FULL point; T004 complete finite native background/thermodynamics and TT/TE/EE exports; T005 exactly four compatible workers, external input identity and output hashes. Local integrity tests use synthetic fixtures and cannot validate physical accuracy. Mandatory numerical/runtime tests remain pending until GitHub execution. Package verification evidence is delivered separately as technical evidence.

UNRESOLVED Actual complete physical histories and qualified reference integration; separate hydrogen/helium trajectory qualification; original-campaign binary equivalence beyond the frozen unchanged diagnostic binary; parent-data hashes not independently present in the preserved records; calibrated scalar/cumulative treatments and their interaction; reference convergence; actual posterior/minimum decision margins. Native x_e/background export does not remove these qualifications. A PASS_NATIVE_DIAGNOSTIC_ONLY never becomes a scientific PASS.

NEXT REQUIRED ACTION: Install the individual prepared files, preserving their paths, and run only Q045-BASELINE-V1 through the permanent launcher. Return its final JSON and worker artifacts to ingestion. If blocked, route the exact failed gate; do not patch helium, change the physical model, resurrect Q040 endpoints or restart closed production.

## CHATGPT-SETUPVURDERING

Current: Work/Codex with local code execution, files, authenticated read-only GitHub and primary-source web retrieval. The assistant is Codex based on GPT-6; the exact active variant and inference effort are not independently exposed. Agent catalogue entries include GPT-6.1 Sol, GPT-6 Astra, GPT-6 Sol, GPT-5.6 Sol and GPT-6 Luna with selectable reasoning in the agent interface. This does not establish the operator's account menu, scientific benchmarks or an automatic mode switch. No model switch or delegation was performed. Context and usage limits and allocated external HPC are not verified.

Recommended primary setup: current Work/Codex with a strong reasoning model at High or deeper, retaining file, repository and numerical execution access; GPT-6.1 Sol at High if selectable. Capability classes H/X + C/A. The immediate task is a small, controlled numerical experiment and source interpretation, not a full posterior campaign. A name-based frontier ranking is unsupported.

Fallback: strongest available high-reasoning configuration with equivalent source/code access and a verified numerical execution environment.
Upgrade trigger: interval reference qualification, switched helium evolution, full-prior likelihood envelopes or competing numerical controls require more reasoning than the current setup can reliably sustain. Extra reasoning cannot supply absent data.
Tools required: YES. Relevant: pinned repository reads, physical-definition primary sources, local arithmetic, complete matched numerical products. Browser, image, deployment and parallel-agent work are unnecessary.

## SAMLET JOURNAL — CURRENT EFFECTIVE UPDATE

This is an update to the same authoritative journal identity supplied for Q044. The complete incoming 524236-byte journal is preserved below, including source registers, claim maps and recovered historical records. SHA256 of those incoming bytes: 2d22b8bb6caa8bb2cec4bc74cfe4b5f6aee59adca3de336182980a74a43b730a. This current section governs routing; inherited stage-specific instructions below describe their historical stages.

Q044 remains CLOSED EPISTEMICALLY INCONCLUSIVE. Q045 remains proposed only and CONTINUES with a finite acquisition handoff. The inherited accepted remote boundary remains v0.5/R000005 through Q043; it was not promoted or reinspected as current main in this stage. No accepted scientific benchmark, mechanism, anomaly, prediction, source pin or original decision threshold changes here. No result is manufactured for the missing 20-cell inference.

### J-045-01 — Main question and present answer

For the frozen Q041 ΛCDM and n_scf=3 EDE configurations, does replacing only the native optical-depth integration functional with a convergent Thomson-integral reference, at identical requested tau_reio and otherwise unchanged physical inputs, alter CMB TT/TE/EE predictions and native likelihood values enough to threaten the original H0/EDE decision margins?

[INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE] A source-level numerical distinction is confirmed. Its realized physical bias, CMB response and inference materiality remain unmeasured. Neither a YES nor a NO follows from the Q044 native-functional hull. No full physical history, calibrated reference pair or relevant actual decision margin was acquired in this stage.

[NEW SOURCE-VERIFIED REFINEMENT] There are TWO conclusion-critical uses of the plus-curvature integration in the pinned backend:
1. The scalar tau_reio calibration in thermodynamics_reionization_get_tau calls array_integrate_all_spline_table_line_to_line.
2. The cumulative optical depth used for exp(-kappa) and the visibility function in thermodynamics_calculate_opticals calls array_integrate_spline_table_line_to_line. That cumulative routine also uses the plus curvature term.

Consequently a scalar-calibration-only change and a cumulative-opacity-only change are different interventions. A claimed complete optical-depth reference must specify both. A wholesale change to shared arrays.c would additionally change unrelated integrations and cannot isolate this question.

This is a numerical-method finding, not evidence of a material H0 bias or new physics.

### J-045-02 — Physical target, variables and units

Use the homogeneous Thomson depth of the frozen cosmological model, not a newly inferred astrophysical truth:

tau_T(z_a,z_b) = integral[z_a,z_b] c * sigma_T * n_e(z) / [(1+z) H(z)] dz.

Here H is the physical expansion rate in s^-1, c in m s^-1, sigma_T in m^2 and physical n_e in m^-3. The result is dimensionless. H must be evaluated from the SAME ΛCDM or n=3 EDE background; substituting a convenient ΛCDM H(z) for EDE changes physics.

Define x_e=n_e/n_H and n_H(z)=n_H0(1+z)^3. Then

tau_T(0,z_s) = c*sigma_T*n_H0 * integral[0,z_s] x_e(z)(1+z)^2/H(z) dz.

x_e includes hydrogen electrons, helium electrons and the inherited residual ionization. In a species decomposition x_e=x_HII+f_He(x_HeII+2*x_HeIII), with f_He=n_He/n_H fixed by the frozen helium abundance and mass convention. Use the fork's actual constants, not an approximate mass ratio silently substituted for them. Do not subtract the residual recombination background, omit helium, change a helium cutoff, add energy injection or replace the reionization parameterization.

Let eta be conformal LENGTH, eta=c*integral dt/a, in Mpc, with eta increasing toward today. Define the nonnegative opacity rate

q(eta) = a*n_e*sigma_T*(metres per Mpc), in Mpc^-1,
kappa_T(eta) = integral[eta,eta_today] q(u) du,
g_T(eta) = q(eta)*exp[-kappa_T(eta)], in Mpc^-1.

Hence dkappa_T/deta=-q. The native positive dkappa column names the scattering rate; it is not the derivative of depth-to-today with that orientation. CLASS's coordinate named tau must not be confused with the dimensionless optical depth tau_reio.

Residual histories, helium, endpoints and background values remain physical inputs. Numerical integration of them does not independently establish that those inputs describe the real Universe.

### J-045-03 — Native support is not an arbitrary redshift cutoff

Pinned thermodynamics_reionization_get_tau scans rows 0 through tt_size-2 with a strict less-than comparison to find the first global x_e minimum in that scanned range. If the minimum is at index 0, the function returns zero. Otherwise N=max(3,i_min), and the spline and scalar integral use rows 0 through N-1. The row i_min is excluded when i_min>=3. The final table row is excluded from the minimum search.

The native tau_table decreases as redshift increases. With h_i=eta_(i+1)-eta_i<0, the routine negates the signed integral at the end. A reference must reproduce this orientation and first compare the identical N rows and identical endpoint eta_(N-1). It must not silently integrate to eta_(i_min).

Separately report the signed endpoint contribution
E_endpoint = integral[eta_(i_min),eta_(N-1)] q(u) du
when i_min>=3. More general common-support comparisons must explicitly label their actual endpoints. The native-zero branch is a definition outcome, not a theorem that all Thomson scattering vanishes.

The minimum selector and estimated spline endpoint derivatives can change when z_reio and the history change. Record those changes. A discontinuous support switch invalidates an unqualified smooth derivative argument. Refining only a frozen spline cannot establish convergence of the underlying electron history.

### J-045-04 — Exact component discrepancy and error decomposition

For the SAME history, SAME N, SAME eta nodes and SAME spline second derivatives m_i=d^2q/deta^2, define signed functionals

J_plus = sum_i [(q_i+q_(i+1))*h_i/2 + (m_i+m_(i+1))*h_i^3/24],
J_minus = sum_i [(q_i+q_(i+1))*h_i/2 - (m_i+m_(i+1))*h_i^3/24].

The exact-real integral of that cubic spline is J_minus. With the native orientation,
F_plus=-J_plus, F_minus=-J_minus,
F_plus-F_minus = -sum_i (m_i+m_(i+1))*h_i^3/12.

The discrepancy has no universal sign when curvature changes. For zero curvature this channel vanishes. Under smooth bounded curvature, the magnitude scales no worse than a curvature bound times sum |h_i|^3/6; that is an interpolation-level statement, not a whole-history certificate.

For the converged physical-model integral R on the identical support,

b = F_plus-R
  = (F_plus-F_minus) + (F_minus-R).

The second term contains history/grid/interpolation error. Floating-point evaluation, endpoint/support error and solver validity require separate accounting. No difference between two correlated methods alone certifies the size of their common error. A corrected minus formula on a fixed grid is therefore a useful control, not automatically a qualified physical reference.

The published Q044 upper/lower native-plus hulls refer to conditional support/rail constructions. They cannot be substituted for b, a fitted tau, the realized spectrum change or a likelihood error.

### J-045-05 — Calibration is the physical bridge

Let t be identical requested tau_reio. For fixed non-reionization inputs theta, let z_plus solve native calibration and z_R solve same-definition reference calibration. Let e_plus=F_plus(z_plus)-t and e_R=R(z_R)-t be actual calibration residuals.

Exactly,
R(z_plus)=t+e_plus-b(z_plus),
R(z_R)-R(z_plus)=b(z_plus)+e_R-e_plus.

Thus identical requested tau does not guarantee identical realized physical depth. Nor does the curvature discrepancy at a frozen trial immediately give a spectrum difference.

If the same support branch is smooth and R'(z)>=s_min>0 throughout the root bracket, then

|z_R-z_plus| <= [|b(z_plus)|+|e_plus|+|e_R|]/s_min.

To first order, z_R-z_plus approximately equals b(z_plus)/R'(z_plus). This derivative must include the actual history response and, if allowed to move smoothly, the endpoint term. For a moving redshift endpoint z_s(z_reio),

dR/dz_reio = integral[0,z_s] W(z)*partial(x_e)/partial(z_reio) dz
             + W(z_s)*x_e(z_s)*dz_s/dz_reio,

where W=c*sigma_T*n_H0*(1+z)^2/H(z), with other physical parameters fixed. At a discrete minimum switch use piecewise brackets or interval root analysis; do not assert monotonicity or invent s_min.

Native bisection stops on a native bracket-width rule proportional to requested tau and reionization_optical_depth_tol. It is not an independent physical tau accuracy certificate. Finite, ordered brackets and a complete valid history must be checked explicitly; a nonfinite comparison or zero-iteration path cannot pass.

### J-045-06 — Visibility exposes an additional channel

Let b_N(z) be the scalar support-specific bias and b_full(eta,z) the cumulative full-table opacity bias for the same physical history. In general they differ, even where their integration domains overlap, because their spline boundary conditions and supports differ.

At the scalar support endpoint, schematically and only after exact support alignment,

kappa_plus(z_plus)-t = e_plus-b_N(z_plus)+b_full(z_plus).

Calibration can partly compensate the scalar bias while leaving a cumulative-opacity bias. Common-backend cancellation is not guaranteed, and scalar agreement alone does not certify the visibility function.

For a fixed q history and a changed cumulative integral,
g_R/g_plus = exp[kappa_plus-kappa_R].
A calibration-induced change also changes q, and must be evaluated as a new physical-model history. Separate both effects experimentally.

High-ell primary screening roughly scales as exp(-2*tau), so the first-order fractional primary-power response is approximately -2*delta_tau at fixed primordial amplitude and other relevant inputs. Low-ell EE and TE also depend on the reionization history. These are sanity estimates only; lensed spectra, TE zeros, lensing observables, parameter compensation and native likelihood response prevent them from supplying a decision certificate. The Planck reionization paper supports the screening/polarization context, not a current frozen-fork tolerance.

### J-045-07 — Native likelihood and scientific-margin relationship

Evaluate ell_a,m,c directly for each arm a, model m and dataset combination c, at identical full cosmological/nuisance vectors, using each frozen native likelihood. Within each arm and model define delta_ell=ell_counterfactual-ell_native. Do not subtract cross-arm absolute likelihoods or multiply two overlapping Planck likelihoods.

If a likelihood term is exactly Gaussian with fixed covariance C, r=D-M_plus and d=M_counterfactual-M_plus, then

delta_chi2 = -2*r^T*C^-1*d + d^T*C^-1*d,
|delta_ell| <= ||r||_(C^-1)*||d||_(C^-1) + (1/2)||d||_(C^-1)^2.

This does not apply unchanged to parameter-dependent covariance or non-Gaussian likelihoods. Use exact native evaluations there. Percent spectral changes and a synthetic covariance are not substitutes for native data weighting. Preserve physical units, C_ell/D_ell conversions, frequency/nuisance conventions and every observable consumed, including lensing and external-distance terms where required.

For fixed-point within-arm model improvement D_a=q_a,LCDM-q_a,EDE, q=-2*ell, evaluation errors bounded by b_a,m give
|delta D_a|<=b_a,LCDM+b_a,EDE.
This becomes a best-fit decision bound only with a qualified same-domain likelihood envelope and separate optimizer uncertainty. Comparing start-vector objectives does not compare best fits.

Retain J-044-05–09: whole-support likelihood oscillation w gives TV<=tanh(w/4); bounded-prior mean error <=R_x*TV; width error <=R_x*sqrt(TV); three-grid overlap error bounds; and separate objective-offset/optimizer bounds. Those derivations remain conditional. Exact finite-point likelihood differences do not supply a uniform w or posterior means.

Original rules remain unchanged: standardized-location threshold 1; overlap 0.50 on 64/80/96 grids; within-arm DeltaChi2 categories <=2, (2,6), >=6; preference portability requires different categories and absolute improvement difference >=2. These are operational predicates, not Gaussian significance or Bayes factors.

No actual original decision margins are available in qualified products here. A finite-point effect can establish an observable-level counterexample or a threat requiring new qualification. It cannot alone establish a changed posterior preference. A negligible-at-diagnostic-points result cannot establish global safety. There is no universal positive tau tolerance independent of actual margins.

### J-045-08 — Controls and checks actually completed

Source recovery: complete pinned arrays.c, thermodynamics.c, original science specification, source lock and production V1 were read. Their SHA256s match the inherited arrays/thermodynamics/spec/lock identities. The cumulative integral call path and the scalar endpoint semantics were inspected directly. The complete pinned execution tree was non-truncated; no committed V31 complete-history product was located. The journal explicitly records V31 as LOCAL_NOT_COMMITTED, with no asserted remote numerical run. The archived readiness record remains historical and does not reopen Q042.

The V29 point ini was read only as prerequisite lineage. Its requested tau=0.022146719553358576 is a diagnostic input, not a current fitted value, optimum, representative EDE vector or qualified calibration result. It supplies neither a complete matched two-model reference set nor nuisances/priors for this investigation.

Independent arithmetic control used exact Python Fraction calculations, not floating-point cosmology:
- Illustrative R(z)=z/100, t=3/50, b=1/1000: native z=59/10, reference z=6 and realized depth change=1/1000 satisfy the calibration identity exactly. These invented rational constants are explicitly a mathematical example, not physical inputs.
- Exact rational checks of (r-d)^2-r^2=d^2-2*r*d passed.
- A constant log-likelihood offset 1/4 in only the EDE model leaves its normalized posterior shape unchanged but shifts an illustrative within-arm improvement from 2 to 5/2, crossing a category boundary. This verifies why posterior-shape agreement does not certify preference.
All three controls passed. A dedicated symbolic package was unavailable; no symbolic-service execution is claimed.
No Q044 fixture campaign, physical history run, CMB calculation, likelihood evaluation, optimizer, posterior or sampler was rerun.

### J-045-09 — Exact finite discriminating acquisition

ONE NEXT TASK: obtain a bounded matched calibration/cumulative-opacity factorial test, with reference uncertainty and explicit scope, before any full inference.

Prospective diagnostic domain:
- Four FULL-contract points: the original frozen start-index-0 full cosmological/nuisance vector for each of camspec/lcdm, hillipop/lcdm, camspec/ede_n3 and hillipop/ede_n3.
- Recover them through the pinned q042_production_v1.py build_info/production_start route, q042_planck_portability_v11.py, its q041 dependency and locked Q032 parent objects. Inspect and freeze every emitted sampled, derived/fixed and nuisance input, complete prior definition and reference hash BEFORE looking at counterfactual output.
- These are diagnostic STARTS, never reconstructed minima. Duplicate physical vectors may share a theory evaluation only after complete identity equality; nuisance likelihoods remain separate.
- No substituted posterior means, incomplete optimizer records, invalid Q040 points, ad hoc midpoint guesses or replacement points after failure. If an input component or locked parent cannot be recovered, the identity gate fails finitely. The failing V29 point may document a prerequisite failure separately; it is not silently added as an eligible reference.

Treatments (calibration flag, cumulative-opacity flag):
00: original native scalar plus and original native cumulative plus.
10: same-support reference scalar calibration, native cumulative plus.
01: native scalar calibration, same-history reference cumulative opacity.
11: reference scalar calibration and reference cumulative opacity.

Primary literal scalar-functional answer is the 10-minus-00 contrast. The 01 contrast isolates opacity/visibility transport. The 11 contrast measures the total Thomson-integration channel, and
Y11-Y10-Y01+Y00 reports interaction for each spectrum/likelihood quantity Y.
Do not label 11-minus-00 a scalar-only change. This definition resolves the two call paths without changing the scientific question or hiding an additional intervention.

Patch scope:
- Preserve the original pin/binary unmodified for 00.
- New documented counterfactual versions may alter only Thomson-depth evaluation at the reionization-calibration call and the cumulative Thomson-depth evaluation used in thermodynamics_calculate_opticals, according to those flags.
- Do not globally replace array routines; drag/damping/background/other integrals stay untouched. No helium treatment, lower-branch fall-through repair, cosmology, requested tau, nuisance, prior, dataset, width, support-selector or cutoff change is part of this test.
- Recover exact original binary/config/compiler identities; record exact patch and resulting binary hashes before execution. Missing identities fail the baseline-reproduction gate.
- If valid complete histories require another physics/solver repair, this isolated experiment is BLOCKED. Record the failure and stop; do not merge that repair into the optical-depth contrast.
- Never resume an old likelihood-containing sampler checkpoint under a new binary.

Reference qualification and separation:
- First evaluate plus, exact-spline minus and independently integrated Thomson depth on the IDENTICAL complete history and native support, with units/orientation and helium/residual accounting explicit.
- Independently cross-check eta-space and redshift-space reference integrals. Their common dependence on the history must be included in the uncertainty.
- Keep the native output grid fixed for the causal contrast. Additional reference nodes and tighter internal evolution are numerical-reference diagnostics and must not replace original native inputs silently.
- Regenerate complete histories at three prospectively frozen reference accuracy levels: baseline, then halved, then quartered relevant thermodynamics integration error controls and reference integration spacings. Freeze exact knobs, baseline values, handling of discrete events and output-grid projection before results. Record every change; comparison at a refined level uses a matched native/control treatment at that level.
- Three agreeing levels are only an empirical convergence diagnostic. A qualified reference needs a defensible remainder bound, supported asymptotic regime or validated residual/error enclosure, including switched-event validity. If that cannot be justified, label reference uncertainty UNQUALIFIED.
- Preserve same native support-selection semantics during calibration; evaluate every fixed-history contrast on identical support first. Report support drift as a separate endpoint term, plus common-endpoint recalculations. Do not use a smooth calibration formula through a discrete selector jump.
- Record requested tau, native reported tau, independently realized same-support depth, full cumulative kappa, z_reio, x_e species/history validity, support indices, endpoints, bisection residual/bracket and numerical uncertainty.

Finite work bound:
- Up to 4 diagnostic points x 4 treatments x 3 matched accuracy levels = 48 theory evaluations, plus one independent repeat of each original 00 baseline for reproducibility: at most 52 theory evaluations before the gate review.
- Independent quadrature evaluations on stored valid histories do not require additional theory jobs.
- At each completed theory point, evaluate each of the five existing external combinations with the unchanged native arm/parameters where their product definitions permit exact reuse. This is 20-point/combinations coverage at fixed diagnostic vectors, not 20 posterior cells. Theory reuse must follow verified likelihood requirements; no accidental omission of an observable is allowed.
- No adaptive domain expansion, new optimizer start, sampler, arbitrary rerun or fourth refinement is authorized by this finite specification. An unresolved gate records its actual reason and hands back evidence for a new decision, rather than assuming more runtime will fix it.

Minimum products:
identity manifest; all 00 raw successes/failures; exact counterfactual patch/build identities; complete species/background/thermodynamic histories; same-support scalar and cumulative quadrature differences with uncertainty; TT/TE/EE and every consumed native observable; per-component and total native likelihood values; factorial contrasts; numerical-response intervals; explicit point/support/combination coverage; missing products and preserved failures. Hash each product and its parent inputs.

Prospective decision and stop gates:
A. Missing identity, invalid history, nonfinite bracket, missing observable, inadmissible reference or unqualified uncertainty -> STOP with INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE and the exact failed prerequisite. A failed baseline is not an EDE/LCDM falsification.
B. A resolved finite-point spectrum/likelihood perturbation -> record its signed size, interval and domain. It establishes sensitivity, not automatic decision materiality.
C. If actual qualified original decision products/margins can be recovered, propagate errors through the unchanged J-044 interval predicates. A certified threshold crossing or inability to exclude one is reported at its warranted inferential scope. Do not reinterpret pointwise DeltaChi2 as optimized model preference.
D. If no actual margin can be recovered, report CONDITIONAL numerical sensitivity or INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE for margin materiality. No replacement tolerance is guessed.
E. A NO/global-negligibility claim requires justified full-domain/support/tail coverage and relevant optimizer/sampling qualification; these four vectors cannot pass that gate by themselves. Stop the bounded acquisition and report the limitation rather than initiating the old full production.
F. End this acquisition when the 52-evaluation bound or a terminal gate is reached. Return evidence for ingestion. If no additional obtainable evidence could change the narrower answer at the documented boundary, then close Q045 epistemically and send the complete same-identity journal to Motor14. This mathematical stage itself does not claim that closure.

No launcher, PROGRAM_ID, GitHub mutation or production dispatch is created here. The receiving execution engine must make the finite experiment concrete and resolve the outstanding execution authority before any remote dispatch. This document is an exact scientific acquisition specification, not permission to run the historical campaign.

## AKTUEL OVERLEVERING

Remaining conclusion-critical uncertainty: the realized calibrated history/visibility/spectrum/native-likelihood response to the isolated integration channel, together with defensible reference uncertainty and its relationship to actual original decision margins.

Why the execution engine: the equations, causal factors, exact source paths and finite stopping gates are now specified. Further algebra cannot supply missing complete matched physical products. Execute or concretely diagnose the single acquisition above; do not repeat Q044 component proofs, generic qualification lists or repository maintenance as a scientific result.

Missing: exact complete diagnostic-vector/parent realization; original baseline binary/config reproduction; valid matched histories; independently qualified scalar/cumulative reference; CMB/native-likelihood contrasts; actual original decision margins; any whole-domain envelope. Each is a gate, not a free input to invent.

Preserve Q044 closure, proposed-Q045 boundary, all inherited failed paths and original 20-cell decision contract. A bounded diagnostic does not reopen Q042 or resolve CamSpec–HiLLiPoP portability.

K7 — Authoritative inherited knowledge and present derivations.
Incoming Q044_SAMLET_JOURNAL, byte count/hash above, contains I-Q044-MATH-QUALIFICATION-001, Q044 component result/checks, V29/V31 provenance and complete preserved source/claim maps.
This current I-Q045-MATH-OPTICAL-TRANSPORT-001 contains the source-call refinement, physical definitions, calibration identities, causal test and exact rational checks. These are internally derived methodological evidence; no independent sky observation is added.

Tools: GitHub read connector -> pinned source/contract content -> local SHA256 and call-path inspection; primary-source web retrieval -> original Planck/CLASS context; file reader -> authoritative journal -> complete historical preservation; local Python standard library -> exact rational checks -> illustrative arithmetic only. The same source retrieved through several routes is still one source.

Evidence strength: STRONG for inspected code formulas/call paths and exact conditional identities; CANNOT BE DETERMINED WITH CURRENT DATA for the actual physical/inferential materiality.
Critical reservations: incomplete matched physical products and reference validation, additional solver failures, support switching, missing margins/domain/tails and optimizer/posterior uncertainty. No current H0 shift, EDE preference or portability class is claimed.

# PRESERVED INCOMING AUTHORITATIVE JOURNAL

The following incoming bytes are preserved unchanged. Their historical timestamps, source registers and results remain recoverable; current routing and Q045 stage status are defined above.


# BUBBLEVERSE — MASTER JOURNAL

AUTHORITATIVE EFFECTIVE STATE AFTER MOTOR14
Date and time: 2026-10-09T17:21:13+00:00 (UTC; runtime clock).
CURRENT CLOSED Q: Q044; established identifier preserved. CASE ID: NOT DOCUMENTED.
NEXT SCIENTIFIC QUESTION: Q045 — PROPOSED; [Q-ID REQUIRES CANONICALIZATION]
No remote Q registration, accepted-model modification, workflow dispatch or production restart occurred.

## Authority and continuity

This is a new version of the same Q044_SAMLET_JOURNAL.md identity, not a competing journal. The effective current global model below governs interpretation. The entire incoming 239491-byte journal follows unchanged as recoverable history, including all 91 inherited source objects, every later addition and all claim maps. The recovered chronological Q001–Q043 record also follows in full as historical transcription. No missing Q010 journal is invented; retrospective early reconstructions remain labelled. Publication narrative and archived instructions retain their historical dates rather than governing current routing.

The three supplied PDFs match EVD-Q043 admission hashes. Their actual chronological record reaches Q043 despite the Q001–Q042 filename. Earlier statements that all global material is unrecovered are SUPERSEDED for the supplied archive, not proof that every original raw historical artifact has been recovered.

## Current global scientific model

1. [SUPPORTED, MULTI-PROBE INFERENCE] The observable Universe is structured and dynamically evolving and has a hotter, denser past. A physical initial singularity is not established. Observation, reconstruction and interpretation remain distinct. Sources: EVD-Q043-QJOURNAL-PDF/Q001, EVD-Q043-MAINBOOK-PDF/chapters1,5; corresponding inherited primary references survive in the historical record.
2. [SUPPORTED UNDER STATED GRAVITATIONAL/COSMOLOGICAL FRAMEWORKS] Non-luminous gravitating phenomena and late acceleration are supported; a dark-matter particle and a microscopic dark-energy mechanism remain unestablished. MECH-LCDM-001 is a supported compact description, not directly observed reality. MECH-DYNDE-001 remains an active model-comparison candidate, not a detected field. Sources: accepted observations/mechanisms at dd7575e7146382957d206e87274ca6246c2587b7; supplied books.
3. [MODEL-INFERRED BENCHMARKS, NOT THREE RAW MEASUREMENTS] Preserve local distance network H0=73.50±0.81, combined Planck+SPT-3G+ACT DR6 flat-ΛCDM H0=67.24±0.35, and DESI DR2+BBN flat-ΛCDM H0=68.51±0.58, all km s^-1 Mpc^-1. These are inherited accepted benchmarks; this Motor14 run did not independently remeasure or revalidate their contemporary primary-data pipelines. Do not combine them indiscriminately or interpret a marginal Gaussian tension as detection of new physics. OBS-H0-LOCAL-001, OBS-H0-CMB-001, OBS-H0-BAOBBN-001; BENCH-H0-*; sources: archived journal/books and accepted benchmark records. Ordinary single-cause explanations rejected in historical tests remain rejected only in those scopes.
4. [ACTIVE/CONSTRAINED] MOD-EDE-N3 / MECH-EDE-N3-001, n_scf=3, can reach high-H0 regions on tested surfaces but is not an established complete solution. MECH-ME-001 (varying electron mass) remains a constrained partial mechanism. Viability depends on datasets, likelihoods, priors, optimizer basin and implementation. Corrected finite-search minima supersede older points where documented; global minima remain unproved. Sources: chronological Q004–Q016, technical appendices and accepted robustness/constraints. Historical ACT attribution stays attached to its actual frozen points.
5. [METHODOLOGICAL RESULT] Q035 resolves historical basin-label disagreement as classifier dependence. Q036–Q038 retain a distributed CamSpec–HiLLiPoP endpoint-geometry difference on matched TT support, localized minimally to omega_b, omega_cdm, f_EDE and theta_i under the tested capture rule. CTR-PLANCK-IMPL-001 and C-036-IMPL remain OPEN_NARROWED. This is overlapping-data implementation evidence, not two independent observations or a physical-systematic identification.
6. [VALIDATED CONDITIONAL NEGATIVE RESULTS] Q039 interventions reject relative calibration alone, native off-diagonal precision alone, their tested combination and native foreground-profile freedom alone as sufficient explanations. Rejecting those interventions does not identify the actual causal mechanism. Sources: EVD-Q039-IMPLBLOCK, EVD-Q039-FGPROFILE; runs34161368438/34184346582 and archived locked definitions.
7. [MATHEMATICALLY SUPPORTED OBJECT; FAILED FINITE IMPLEMENTATIONS] Q040 separately marginalizes each native nuisance space around a common physical CMB object. Laplace/Schur and defensive RQMC failed mandatory qualification before endpoints; do not revive those endpoints or interpret numerical failure as physical falsification. EVD-Q040-RQMC, run34258155387.
8. [CONTROLLED NO SCIENTIFIC RESULT] Q041 V19 obtained 0/32 documented complete converged chains; 30 reached frozen sample limits, two remained partial. Its narrower EDE-only campaign omitted ΛCDM controls/common SN and differs from the original20-cell contract. Run34979609004 success validated a terminal firewall, not cosmology. Original downstream portability remains scientific debt.
9. [CLOSED INCONCLUSIVE GENERAL FEASIBILITY] Q042 did not qualify the original20-cell matrix. V29 recovered context is prerequisite-only; V30/V31 histories were partial; the cap32 incompatibility is conditional on its append-only support representation, not universal infeasibility. No completed physical tau/prediction result is resurrected.
10. [CLOSED TECHNICAL PREPARATION; SUBSEQUENT PUBLICATION VERIFIED] Q043 originally established local candidate preparation only. Subsequent installation run37927147545 and receipt now establish accepted v0.5/R000005 through Q043. This changes repository provenance, not physical models, benchmarks or production authorization. No Q044 acceptance is implied.
11. [CLOSED EPISTEMICALLY INCONCLUSIVE] Q044 establishes support-specific adjoint real-arithmetic component bounds under the inherited hydrogen rail, source witnesses and fixed knots. R-Q044-SPLINE-ADJOINT-001 is accepted with those scope limits; R-Q044-SPLINE-INGESTION-002 preserves the evidence-boundary closure. Original downstream class remains NOT_AVAILABLE. No H0 difference, qualified equivalence, dataset-conditional conclusion or EDE/ΛCDM preference has been established.
12. [OPEN PHYSICAL VALIDITY GAP] Frozen CLASS_EDE optical-depth integration uses the historical plus curvature correction; the ordinary cubic integral uses minus. The official upstream source documents that correction. Synthetic exact/native tests establish a functional difference, not a physical optical-depth bias or inference-level effect. Error-budget relevance to CMB predictions is still unmeasured. This distinction is central to the proposed next question.

## Active tensions, predictions and unresolved state

- CTR-H0-001: OPEN inference-chain TENSION; no robust same-assumption fundamental contradiction is newly established.
- C-036-IMPL / CTR-PLANCK-IMPL-001: OPEN_NARROWED methodological implementation tension; historical IDs are cross-references, not newly independent conflicts.
- CTR-HIST-BASIN-LABEL-001: RESOLVED_METHODOLOGICALLY; do not reopen without new evidence.
- PRED-H0-INDEPENDENT-001, PRED-EDE-PORTABILITY-001, PRED-Q039-COUPLED-001: all OPEN. Q044 adds insufficient-qualification history, not a failed physical prediction.
- Open: dark-matter identity, acceleration microphysics, global topology/size beyond accessible evidence, earliest-epoch interpretation, EDE globality, causal likelihood structure, complete-history/upstream/binary reference accuracy and posterior convergence. None is resolved by this local mathematical component.

## New component result retained exactly in scope

UPPER:138 supports3195..3332; conditional native-plus hull [0.70676532823050475,0.7067869701940579]; width2.1641963553142851e-05.
LOWER:3002 supports331..3332; conditional native-plus hull [0.0016297839913017342,0.0018091545475532051]; width0.00017937055625147098.
Values are dimensionless component enclosure extrema, not measured optical depths. Source boxes are correlated physically; independent-box extrema can be conservative/unattainable.64 rational fixtures and18 native-C diagnostics passed in the received result, not rerun here.17 V29 members matched in the received recovery. Uniform original-binary rounding, full history/grid accuracy and physical/inferential adequacy remain UNRESOLVED. No more fixture repetition is prescribed.

## Revision actions

ADD: scoped component knowledge and its accepted epistemic closure; prospective physical-validity question.
REFINE: distinguish exact-real native functional bounds from physical Thomson depth and from posterior qualification.
UPDATE: current repository accepted v0.5/R000005/Q043; full global archive now accessible.
SUPERSEDE: stale current-state v0.4-only/no-promotion descriptions and generic repeat-design/ingestion instructions. Preserve their historical truth.
KEEP: scientific benchmark values and uncertainties; all physical model/candidate statuses; all source IDs/claim mappings; rejected scoped mechanisms; contradictions and open predictions.
No active physical hypothesis or prediction is deleted by Q044; no independent cosmological evidence is added.

## Dependency propagation and scientific debt

The conditional hull clears only a representation/storage subproblem. It does not clear reference accuracy -> CMB prediction accuracy -> native likelihood accuracy -> posterior/model-decision qualification. Every downstream result relying on an unqualified physical reference remains unqualified; original scientific thresholds stay frozen. Earlier validated geometry is not retroactively invalidated merely by an unmeasured potential integration effect.
Originating casesQ041–Q042; carried throughQ043–Q044: materiality/portability of likelihood-dependent H0/EDE inference remains unresolved. Storage representation is PARTIALLY CLEARED; complete-history, physical functional, binary arithmetic, likelihood transport and convergence blockers remain ACTIVE. Resume one distinct science subquestion; do not reopen Q044's completed bounded audit or dispatch the old production campaign.

## Prioritized scientific backlog

SELECTED HIGH — Q045 — PROPOSED; [Q-ID REQUIRES CANONICALIZATION]: For the frozen Q041 ΛCDM and n_scf = 3 EDE configurations, does replacing only the native optical-depth integration functional with a convergent Thomson-integral reference, at identical requested τ_reio and otherwise unchanged physical inputs, alter CMB TT/TE/EE predictions and native likelihood values enough to threaten the original H0/EDE decision margins?
Reason: tests a specific known numerical/physical distinction at the shared backend, with possible consequences for both model branches and both likelihood arms. A demonstrated material effect would require new qualification of affected scientific outputs; a controlled negligible effect would eliminate this particular threat within its tested domain. It would not resolve other accuracy channels or Q044's full posterior question. Start: BUBBLEVERSE — AUTONOMOUS MATHEMATICS ENGINE.
HIGH, existing prediction PRED-EDE-PORTABILITY-001: original20-cell H0/model portability; deferred scientific debt, not newly numbered/reworded as Q045.
HIGH, existing prediction PRED-Q039-COUPLED-001: whether valid coupled native-likelihood harmonization accounts for the residual geometry; preserve prior failed routes and native spaces. Start when warranted: documented research/consistency specialist according to exact remaining bottleneck.
HIGH, existing PRED-H0-INDEPENDENT-001: an observationally independent H0 inference able to discriminate chains; no new measurement or claim of available1% data is supplied here. Start: documented research.
MEDIUM: remaining finite-search EDE globality/robustness questions in the historical backlog; do not confuse finite minimizer success with global proof. Broad unformulated microphysical unknowns remain background uncertainties, not fabricated numbered tasks.
Priority selection is conditional on the documented backend validity gap; it is not a claim that this gap is a measured dominant systematic. No new direct robust contradiction outranks it in the supplied state.

## Scientific question firewall and ID boundary

PASS: scientific object is reionization/optical depth, CMB spectra and scientific likelihood inference; answer is constrained by mathematics, reference calculations and data-weighted response; yes/no/conditional/insufficient-evidence endpoints change qualification status; wording assumes no effect; no maintenance endpoint. Q045 tests a specific functional-to-observable consequence, whereas Q044 asked for the full cross-arm posterior/model classification.
Q044 is the preserved operator scientific identifier; remote authoritative boundary endsQ043 and does not admitQ044. Q045 is proposed only; reconcile/admit canonical numbering before registration. Never reuseQ044 or pretendQ045 is registered. This ID prerequisite must not be made into a universe question.

## Non-Q technical follow-up

Record Q044 closure and this revision in the controlled model-update route when authorized; source README/registry synchronization remains separate pending work. Do not overwrite accepted snapshots or change source pins. Complete matched histories/reference products and a quantitative inference-error bridge are execution prerequisites for the selected scientific question. No blanket production authority is granted. No new PROGRAM_ID or launcher target is created in Motor14. Repository contents are unchanged.

## Source/claim supplement

All inherited sources and mapping trees below remain intact. The accepted model state is scientific-project synthesis, not independent evidence. Publication sources remain primary where actually documented; archival references not newly verified retain their limitations, including the book's explicit K-033 verification gap. Newly checked historical reionization/CLASS literature supplies method context only, not new parameter values or a calibrated Bubbleverse accuracy target.

## Effective end state

Physical scientific model unchanged; numerical knowledge refined/extended; evidence limits narrowed and scientific debt explicit. No new robust connection candidate, fundamental contradiction or required reopening of a previous closed case is established. This does not mean every possible cross-domain connection has been excluded.
THE NEXT PROPOSED BUBBLEVERSE Q IS A SCIENTIFIC QUESTION, NOT A MAINTENANCE ACTION.

---
# PRESERVED INCOMING JOURNAL — HISTORICAL VERSION
The following bytes are unchanged. Current-state interpretations and routing are superseded by the effective state above wherever explicitly indicated.

# BUBBLEVERSE — COMPLETED Q → MOTOR 14 HANDOFF

RD OF THE UNIVERSE
Date and time: 2026-10-09T18:53:38.281918+02:00 (Europe/Copenhagen); 2026-10-09T16:53:38.281918+00:00 (UTC).

STATUS: QUESTION RESOLVED
CASE ID: NOT DOCUMENTED
CURRENT Q: Q044 — unchanged operator-proposed identifier; canonical remote registration NOT PERFORMED.
QUESTION: Under the original Q041 matched-data and prior contract, does the CamSpec–HiLLiPoP implementation difference produce a material difference in H0 constraints or the n_scf = 3 EDE-versus-ΛCDM conclusion once numerical prediction accuracy and posterior convergence are qualified, or is the downstream result equivalent or conditional on the external dataset combination?
SELECTED NEXT ENGINE: BUBBLEVERSE — MOTOR 14: AUTONOMOUS UNIVERSE REVISION.

## FINAL ANSWER

INCONCLUSIVE / INSUFFICIENT SCIENTIFIC QUALIFICATION.
Current documented evidence establishes none of: material H0/EDE inference difference, qualified equivalence, or external-dataset conditional behavior under the original Q041 contract. A conditional mathematical component has been computed; the qualified downstream comparison remains unavailable.

## EPISTEMIC STATUS

Q044 is CLOSED EPISTEMICALLY at the documented evidence boundary. The original scientific contract classifier remains NOT_AVAILABLE. This is not a cosmological null result, evidence of equivalence, universal numerical infeasibility or physical falsification. QUESTION RESOLVED denotes a defensible insufficient-evidence closure; the physical answer remains unknown. Preserve PRED-EDE-PORTABILITY-001, PRED-H0-INDEPENDENT-001 and PRED-Q039-COUPLED-001 as OPEN. Scientific debt survives the closure.

## RECOMMENDED CHATGPT EXECUTION PROFILE

Exposed configurations considered: GPT-6.1 Sol, GPT-6 Astra, GPT-6 Sol, GPT-5.6 Sol, GPT-6 Luna. Actual capabilities include Work/Codex files/Python/C, connected GitHub retrieval, web research, Library persistence and parallel-agent facilities. Exact current model/reasoning, full operator selector, context/usage limits and comparative reliability are NOT VERIFIED. No model switch or agents were used.
Recommended Motor14 setup: strong reasoning in Work/Codex, GPT-6.1 Sol High if selectable; classes C+E under the ingestion taxonomy. Fallback: strongest equivalent available reasoning with complete journal/source access. Escalate for genuinely difficult global contradictions or context complexity. Motor14 needs cross-case integration; another production campaign, broad cosmology search or fixture replay is not selected.

## WHY Q IS SUFFICIENTLY DOCUMENTED

The requested finite support-functional task produced actual new mathematical information. The received boundaries are usable within their explicit conditions. Targeted retrieval of original scientific criteria, treatment-readiness design/record and initialized-context contract did not recover a qualified endpoint error bridge or valid matched reference products. These records explicitly preserve missing full-history/prediction/likelihood accuracy. The current record has no qualified original20-cell downstream verdict.

Further generic derivations, repetition of the same hull, more hash audits or the already passed component tests cannot produce the missing evidence. A future independently qualified reference and inference campaign could change the physical answer; that is genuinely new evidence, not an implication of the present component. Close the bounded evidence-based investigation INCONCLUSIVE rather than repeat its design/validation loop. Closure is not merely a response to elapsed time or lack of production authorization. No claim excludes every possible future method.

## SAMLET JOURNAL

Q044_SAMLET_JOURNAL.md is the updated same-identity authoritative journal, containing this effective closure supplement and the entire218195-byte incoming journal verbatim. All six incoming JSON blocks parse. The original91 source objects have91 unique IDs; both inherited claim-map trees and all subsequent additions survive. The earlier196340-byte tail still matches its preserved hash. Separately missing global master-journal content remains NOT RECOVERED; CASE ID remains NOT DOCUMENTED.

## DECISIVE EVIDENCE

- R-Q044-SPLINE-ADJOINT-001 reports conditional fixed-knot native-plus bounds, inference adequacy UNDETERMINED, native-binary rounding NOT CERTIFIED and no complete recovered V31 history.
- The exact q042_production_spec_v1.json matches SHA25641e4d8f026933f64dbe41048f894002f479ba2b504432b33dc155f4dfe71378c. It provides original materiality/model-preference criteria, not treatment prediction/likelihood accuracy.
- The retrieved readiness record leaves matched reference products and justified numerical tolerances missing. The V29 context contract separates original-binary arithmetic and upstream/table/entry accuracy as UNRESOLVED gates; its scope is prerequisite-only.
- No supplied qualified20-cell comparison fills this gap. Invalid Q040 endpoints, narrower Q041V19 non-result, partial Q042 records and Q043 technical preparation cannot replace it.

## SUPPORTING EVIDENCE

All ten attached files were inspected for their roles; the eight declared reproduction hashes and five validation hashes match. Fresh ingestion checks verify exact unique support coverage, correct native N/index relation, ordered intervals and aggregation of every recorded support cell into the declared hull. No mathematical-program, C-replay or artifact-extraction rerun was performed here. The64 rational fixtures,18 C replays and17 V29 member matches remain reported validation from the Mathematics result, not fresh independent reproduction.
Execution main remains72cf9e92fc794c122f593a77b6a555e6e97f6a2e. Frozen source contents were fetched read-only at that pin. This is a targeted audit of specified contracts, not an exhaustive search of every external system or artifact.

## WHAT WAS ESTABLISHED

Support-specific adjoint weights and real-arithmetic residual enclosures were implemented under documented conditions. All3140 inherited candidate supports have computed bounds. A scalar union hull represents the candidate interval union with two extrema, although every support is retained in diagnostics.

| Trial | Candidates | Conditional dimensionless native-plus bounds | Width |
|---|---:|---|---:|
| UPPER | 138 | [0.70676532823050475, 0.7067869701940579] | 2.1641963553142851e-05 |
| LOWER | 3002 | [0.0016297839913017342, 0.0018091545475532051] | 0.00017937055625147098 |

These are conservative component enclosure extrema under inherited rail/witness assumptions, not observed or fitted optical depths. The frozen V31 stored-support cap32 limitation remains conditionally valid; this distinct scalar representation does not retroactively repair or reproduce V31.

## WHAT WAS NOT ESTABLISHED

No new H0, posterior convergence, materiality class, EDE/LCDM preference, equivalence, dataset-conditional result, physical causality or physical falsification. No qualified full-history/prediction/likelihood reference or uniform original-binary error proof. A scalar bound controls one functional of a history; no supplied quantitative implication bounds every relevant prediction or the posterior decision endpoints. Its width alone cannot demonstrate inference adequacy.

## FALSIFIED / REJECTED ALTERNATIVES

Preserve Q035 classifier correction, Q039 tested clean-block negatives, Q040 invalid scientific endpoints, Q041V19's contract boundary and the unchanged V31 failure. No newly falsified physical hypothesis.
Reject unsupported upgrading of the component to a qualified reference/posterior, deriving a scientific tau tolerance from PolyChord precision_criterion0.001, optimizer settings or the1e-4 bracket stopping rule, treating finite native-C diagnostic agreement as a uniform error proof, and inferring equivalence from absent qualified posteriors. These are invalid inference substitutions, not tests falsifying cosmology.

## UNEXPLAINED ANOMALIES

C-036-IMPL remains OPEN_NARROWED. Internal fitted geometry remains documented; physical origin and downstream significance remain unknown. Native-plus versus exact-cubic-minus is a preserved known technical distinction, not newly discovered physics. Raw unexpected values remain exact; surprise is not a validity filter.

## REMAINING UNCERTAINTIES

Full native/history/grid accuracy, physical applicability of inherited rails/support assumptions, complete prediction-to-likelihood/posterior bounds, converged20-cell inference and implementation causality remain unresolved. They limit present evidence without proving nature is unknowable or future numerical methods impossible. A future new-evidence study may address them.

## BUBBLEVERSE-GENERATED RESULTS

Received R-Q044-SPLINE-ADJOINT-001: CONDITIONAL MATHEMATICAL / NUMERICAL COMPONENT RESULT, ACCEPTED WITH SCOPE LIMITS. I-Q044-SPLINE-CHECKS-001: reported component validation. I-Q044-V29-BYTE-RECOVERY-001: reported original context/grid recovery.
New R-Q044-SPLINE-INGESTION-002: SOURCE / QUALIFICATION / JOURNAL-INTEGRATION RESULT. No new numerical production, program registration or scientific computation.

## INTERNAL RESULT PROVENANCE

Q044_SPLINE_INGESTION_RESULT.json contains all ten attachment sizes/hashes, audit checks, fresh source records, source-to-claim mappings, completion boundary and journal actions. Component environment inherited: Python3.12.14, NumPy2.3.5, MPFR4.2.1 with256-bit directed source calculations; exact Fraction fixtures; local C wrapper compiled -shared -fPIC -O0 -fno-fast-math -ffp-contract=off. Full compiler details remain in the preserved journal/checks.
Native source mwt5345/class_ede@5a131c91d657dd9a7c6364cc45b038710f8d0d97. arrays.c c38471b1395bc111817b2467db9af9795e1e1ab0ef2a441ecca801a82adc09c4; thermodynamics.c d17657c1cbd9fd4b70d62d1c6eb102a128ee1ed4cbc5dae439254af91bc45fb6. V29 run37362125253/artifact11366628579 and context/grid/prefix hashes survive. Complete V31 raw histories remain absent here.
New chain/sampler/likelihood products: NOT COMPUTED. Remote mutation, workflow dispatch, production restart, threshold changes and model promotion: NONE. Production remains NOT AUTHORIZED. New PROGRAM_ID: NONE. The accepted remote model state recorded historically is unchanged by this local closure.

## WEB / PLUGIN / TOOL RESEARCH

YES: targeted connected GitHub primary technical-source retrieval and local file/JSON audit. Questions: original criteria intact? Ready endpoint reference/error bridge in inspected contracts? Execution head changed? Source snapshots and hashes are preserved in Q044_ENDPOINT_SOURCE_EVIDENCE.json.
New external cosmological observations, broad survey and independent physical replication: NONE. Project contracts and computation remain internal technical evidence. No contradictory qualified cosmological outcome was recovered. The source audit confirms a finite qualification boundary; more general source summaries cannot generate the missing matched numerical products. No tool failure or fabricated fallback result contributed to this ingestion.

## COMPLETE ACTIVE SOURCE REGISTER

The full91-object inherited register, later additions and complete claim maps remain verbatim in Q044_SAMLET_JOURNAL.md. This section supplements them, not replaces them. Conclusion-critical active records:

- I-Q044-CONTRACT-001 / I-Q042-TREATMENT-003: frozen original20-cell science specification, SHA25641e4d8f026933f64dbe41048f894002f479ba2b504432b33dc155f4dfe71378c.

- I-Q042-COMPARISON-V31-001 / I-Q042-COMPARISON-V31-VALIDATION-001 / I-Q042-V31-INGESTION-001: partial computational output and conditional cap32 limitation, no full scientific comparison.
- I-Q044-MATH-QUALIFICATION-001: preserved conditional likelihood/posterior error mathematics, still lacking a qualified likelihood envelope.
- I-Q044-SPLINE-INGESTION-002 and I-Q044-ENDPOINT-CONTRACT-AUDIT-001: this ingestion and targeted frozen-contract audit. Full metadata and actual URLs follow in the JSON supplement.

## CLAIM-TO-SOURCE MAP

All inherited mappings survive. Add C-Q044-I06–I10 as recorded below. Traceability: attached inputs/result/checks → conditional component → inspected endpoint contracts → insufficient qualification → Motor14. This does not convert project computation into external cosmological evidence.

## SUPERSEDED MATERIAL / JOURNAL EFFECT

ADD scoped acceptance, endpoint-contract audit and evidence-boundary closure. UPDATE current Q044 workflow CONTINUES to CLOSED INCONCLUSIVE; destination MOTOR14. Supersede current instructions to repeat generic qualification design or return indefinitely to ingestion. Preserve every historical continuation instruction with its original temporal scope. KEEP physical parameters, candidates, tensions, predictions, rejected paths and accepted-model boundaries.

## IMPORTANT ASSUMPTIONS

Component: fixed decoded knots/constants, inherited hydrogen rail/support set, residual helium/source-write semantics and stated outward-rounding assumptions. The real-arithmetic native-plus target differs from exact-cubic-minus and uniform original-binary qualification. Planck arms overlap in data and are not independent observations; descriptive normalized mean differences are not automatically independent-Gaussian significance.
Preserve original two native Planck arms, LCDM/n_scf3EDE, FULL and four LOO combinations, ACTDR6 primary/lensing, DESIDR2, identical frozen supernova likelihood, common priors/model definitions and native nuisances. Preserve all decision rules. No arbitrary accuracy tolerance is invented.

## IMPLICATIONS ALREADY VISIBLE

Bubbleverse has a new conditional scalar-enclosure method, not a new accepted H0 or EDE-portability verdict. Qualification debt and implementation tension remain explicit. Motor14 determines final knowledge revision and canonical registration. This local ingestion changes no repository/model publication state.

## POSSIBLE FUTURE QUESTIONS / NEW-EVIDENCE CONDITIONS

Future qualified investigation of the unresolved physical objective requires independently valid matched references, an applicable complete error envelope and a preregistered converged inference comparison. A materially changed treatment needs a new numerical lineage and validity evidence before importing cosmological claims. These are genuine new-evidence conditions, not automatic rerouting or a new Q allocation here. Motor14 chooses any next canonical scientific question; repository maintenance does not replace the scientific objective.

## NEXT TASK FOR MOTOR 14

Integrate this CLOSED INCONCLUSIVE case with accumulated knowledge. Classify the mathematical gain, preserve complete sources/claim maps and original open physical predictions, and retain numerical qualification debt. Do not promote conditional/partial evidence to a physical result, revive rejected paths or infer EDE/standard-model preference. Verify any canonical Q allocation against the current authoritative registry before registration. Select future scientific work only for a specific new-evidence opportunity; do not reopen the completed bounded audit as another validation loop. All state and provenance accompany that decision.

## CHATGPT-SETUPVURDERING

Actual verified work style: Codex in ChatGPT Work, filesystem/Python/C, connected GitHub source/artifact access and Library persistence. Exact current model variant/reasoning allocation, context capacity and usage limits are NOT VERIFIED. Exposed execution candidates include GPT-6.1 Sol, GPT-6 Astra, GPT-6 Sol, GPT-5.6 Sol and GPT-6 Luna; availability is not a benchmark of comparative reliability or the operator's full model selector. No model switch or sub-agent was used.
Recommended primary: strong mathematical reasoning in Work/Codex; GPT-6.1 Sol High if selectable with equivalent tools. Capability classes H/X + A + C under the Mathematics Engine taxonomy. Current tool-equipped setup completed this bounded task. Fallback: strongest available equivalent high-reasoning setup. Upgrade only for a materially more complex coupled error analysis or unresolved inconsistency; do not escalate merely for formatting.
Tool need: YES. Actual uses: frozen GitHub sources and artifact byte retrieval, local bounded exact/interval computation and original-journal persistence. Browser, production/HPC, general literature survey and parallel agents were unnecessary.

## SAMLET JOURNAL — effective differential update

The entire incoming journal is preserved byte-for-byte below, including all 91 inherited source objects, both inherited claim-map trees and every later Q044 addition. This is a new version of the same authoritative journal, not a separate mathematics journal. Full global master-journal material absent from the attachment remains NOT RECOVERED. Historical next-step instructions are historical; current entries below govern this handoff.
Incoming journal: 196340 bytes; SHA256 e9363e8a236a955ab1fe258e27c09c4484771540bb19948f838d271c1b2bc26d.

### J-044-20 — Actual frozen-input recovery

[TECHNICAL EVIDENCE] Original context artifact11366628579 from run37362125253 was retrieved. Its archive SHA256 matches3a543d095512e7ea46447275bee8df112704bd128f725d04a500a62c9dcd6aa9, and all17 member hashes declared by q042_context_result_v29.json match. Actual context, native grid and shared-prefix hashes match the preserved V31 basis. The full native grid contains28333 rows. Rows0..3333 are used as fixed decoded binary64 real inputs, with increasing redshift and decreasing conformal time. The grid is not a certified uncertainty envelope for the continuum history. Below50, V29 CSV rows labelled NOT_ACQUIRED are not measurements; their placeholder zeros were not used.

V31 full UPPER/LOWER node and step histories were not recovered. A recursive search of the pinned execution tree found no committed V31 raw-history paths, consistent with LOCAL_NOT_COMMITTED. The existing cap certificate retains33 actual source-xe interval witnesses per trial and the conditional global hydrogen rail. Its candidate sets are used only under its existing admissibility/domain/prefix assumptions. No missing hydrogen values are guessed.

### J-044-21 — Support-specific native functional

[DERIVED] Let x_i=eta_i in Mpc, y_i=dkappa_i in Mpc^-1, h_i=x_{i+1}-x_i<0 and d_i=(y_{i+1}-y_i)/h_i. For argmin index j>0 use N=max(3,j) and rows0..N-1. For j=0 return tau=0 as frozen native code does. The argmin row itself is excluded when j>=3. No common final-spline weights are substituted for different N.

Estimated endpoint derivatives are

s_0=d_0-h_0(d_1-d_0)/(h_0+h_1),
s_L=d_{N-2}+h_{N-2}(d_{N-2}-d_{N-3})/(h_{N-3}+h_{N-2}).

With M_i=y''(x_i), A_N M=B_N y is symmetric tridiagonal:
- First: 2h_0 M_0+h_0 M_1=6(d_0-s_0).
- Interior: h_{i-1}M_{i-1}+2(h_{i-1}+h_i)M_i+h_iM_{i+1}=6(d_i-d_{i-1}).
- Last: h_{N-2}M_{N-2}+2h_{N-2}M_{N-1}=6(s_L-d_{N-2}).

Define t_i as half the sum of adjacent h and c_i as one twenty-fourth of the sum of adjacent h^3, using only existing adjacent segments. The frozen native-plus functional is

T_N(y)=-(t_N^T y+c_N^T A_N^-1 B_N y)=a_N^T y,
a_N=-t_N-B_N^T lambda_N, A_N^T lambda_N=c_N.

A single tridiagonal adjoint solve produces all N weights in O(N); all candidate prefixes were computed separately. The endpoint boundary depends on N. A measured difference between N3195 weights and the first3195 coordinates of N3332 weights is approximately0.1388881954 Mpc (maximum coordinate difference), directly disproving unrestricted reuse of one common spline-weight vector.

The exact cubic-segment integral has a MINUS second-derivative term. Its diagnostic functional would use a_N=-t_N+B_N^T lambda_N. The production target remains NATIVE_PLUS. For x=(2,1,0), y=(4,1,0), native-plus yields10/3 whereas the cubic integral is8/3. This is the inherited technical distinction, not new physics and not an authorized correction of the frozen model.

Dimensions: M has Mpc^-3, A has Mpc, c has Mpc^3, lambda has Mpc^2 and a has Mpc. Therefore T is dimensionless. h<0 requires the native final minus sign. Nonmonotone knots, zero denominators or nonfinite bounds fail fast.

### J-044-22 — Outward coefficient and box certificates

[DERIVED CONDITIONAL] For a finite approximate adjoint lambda_hat, compute r=c-A lambda_hat with outward interval arithmetic. All h have the same negative sign, so A is strictly diagonally dominant. The exact margin is |h_0| or |h_last| at the endpoints and |h_prev+h_next| internally. A safe lower bound delta is min lower(|h_i|)>0. At a maximum absolute-error coordinate,

|r_k| >= (|A_kk|-sum_(j!=k)|A_kj|)*||lambda-lambda_hat||_inf,

hence ||lambda-lambda_hat||_inf <= ||r||_inf/delta.

This residual bound remains valid even if the approximate solve is imperfect; it is propagated outward through B^T and t. Ordinary binary64 Thomas elimination supplies an approximation only. Coefficient/box algebra uses separate nextafter-directed enclosures for each elementary operation; sums use outward pairwise reduction, not an unbounded ordinary np.sum. It assumes the observed finite IEEE-754 binary64 arithmetic with gradual underflow and round-to-nearest primitive operations. MPFR4.2.1 at256 bits with directed binary64 export is reused for source powers/tanh. No fast-math compilation is used.

For exact a and independent ordinate intervals [l_i,u_i], the sharp box range is
L_N=sum_i min(a_i*l_i,a_i*u_i), U_N=sum_i max(a_i*l_i,a_i*u_i).

With coefficient intervals, outward term products and sums enclose those exact endpoints. Over an admissible support set S, [min_(N in S)L_N,max_(N in S)U_N] is a conservative scalar union hull. It requires only two final extrema; the delivered diagnostics preserve every candidate. Sharpness applies to the abstract independent box, not to physically attainable correlated trajectories or argmin-conditioned histories. Ignoring these correlations widens the enclosure; it does not falsely tighten it.

### J-044-23 — Concrete source boxes and computed hull

[CONDITIONAL NUMERICAL COMPONENT RESULT] Reused frozen constants include nH0 in m^-3, sigma in m^2, Mpc in m, fixed residual helium and fHe. At each z<=50, set xn=xH+fHe*xHe. The inherited rail is xH in[0,0x1.fb4196502b73fp-13], conditional on the existing certificate's global analytic-rail assumptions. Its truth for a new physical history is not proved here.

Write F=(1+tanh(arg))/2 and He=fHe*(1+tanh((he_center-z)/he_width))/2 within each trial's native reionization branch; F=He=0 outside it. The frozen smoothing q is1 for z<=46 and s^2(3-2s) with s=(50-z)/4 for46<z<=50. Then

xe_source=(1-qF)*xn+q*(F*after+He).

This affine form avoids duplicating xn with artificial interval dependency. Since0<=q,F<=1, beta=1-qF lies in[0,1]; intersecting beta with this analytically established range is justified. Each source box is intersected with its retained witness, where present; empty intersections fail. y=(1+z)^2*nH0*sigma*Mpc*xe_source. Powers, tanh and conversion are outward-rounded. No placeholder CSV hydrogen history or posterior is used.

Actual results for the NATIVE_PLUS exact-real component:

| Trial | Candidate supports | Lower bound | Upper bound | Width | Lower/upper attaining enclosure supports |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| UPPER | 138 | 0.70676532823050475 | 0.7067869701940579 | 2.1641963553142851e-05 | 3195 / 3332 |
| LOWER | 3002 | 0.0016297839913017342 | 0.0018091545475532051 | 0.00017937055625147098 | 331 / 3332 |

The lower/upper support indices identify enclosure extrema, not fitted or observed physical supports. All138 UPPER candidates3195..3332 and3002 LOWER candidates331..3332 were included, with N=their native index (no extra row). Total candidate coverage3140/3140. The maximum adjoint error bound over these prefixes is9.400182335212992e-11 Mpc^2; maximum weight interval width is1.4563791617128174e-8 Mpc. Elapsed component calculation 16.768s locally, not an HPC campaign estimate.

This establishes a computed bounded scalar representation under documented conditions despite the unchanged V31 stored-interval cap32 failure. It does not refute that frozen representation-specific failure, prove general feasibility, certify a physical tau or resolve Q044. No Q042 reopening, cap expansion or numerical production occurred.

### J-044-24 — Finite cross-checks and qualification boundary

[TECHNICAL VALIDATION] PASS within component scope:64 cases of exact Fraction forward-spline elimination on independent small nonuniform integer grids, all coefficient enclosures checked against exact rational basis weights, plus point functional enclosures; exact constant/linear/quadratic cubic-minus limits; preserved native-plus10/3 witness. Seed44044. Maximum fixture enclosure width5.450715434562881e-10 in the chosen arbitrary ordinate units. Early development issues in interval tuple length and NumPy-integer Fraction conversion were corrected before the recorded run; no failed-development output is a scientific result.

Eighteen independent C replays use unchanged pinned function bodies with a local wrapper, compiled -shared -fPIC -O0 -fno-fast-math -ffp-contract=off; compiler gcc (Ubuntu 13.3.0-6ubuntu2~24.04) 13.3.0. Each trial uses first/middle/last candidate supports and midpoint/min-sign/max-sign ordinate choices. Every binary64 replay value falls inside its own computed exact-real component enclosure (maximum outside distance0). The diagnostic tolerance is1e-9*max(1,abs(value)), declared solely for component comparison, not a cosmological accuracy margin. This empirical finite check does not prove a uniform error bound for the frozen original binary or its other operations.

Final math component status: CONDITIONAL_BOUNDED_RESULT / COMPONENT_CHECKS_PASS.
Native-binary global rounding-error gate: UNRESOLVED.
Hydrogen/history and fixed-grid physical truth gate: UNRESOLVED.
Prediction-to-likelihood-to-posterior qualification gate: UNRESOLVED.
Q044 final scientific gate: NOT_YET_SATISFIED.
PRODUCTION_RESTART_AUTHORIZED: false.

### J-044-25 — Journal effects and exact remaining bottleneck

KEEP all Q035–Q043 historical outcomes, sources, parameters, candidates, original20-cell contract and decision rules. C-036-IMPL remains OPEN_NARROWED; portability predictions remain OPEN. No H0 estimate, EDE/LCDM preference, equivalence, physical causality or physical falsification is added. The inherited H0 benchmark numbers retain their missing primary-source details and are not used as independent test inputs here.

ADD actual V29 byte recovery, support-specific adjoint proof, conditional all-support scalar hull, finite exact/native cross-checks and provenance. UPDATE the earlier UNIMPLEMENTED mathematical support-hull direction to IMPLEMENTED_AND_COMPUTED_CONDITIONALLY. Historical statements that no artifact bytes/no support weights were computed retain their original temporal scope; they are superseded only for the current stage.

The decisive remaining uncertainty is whether a COMPLETE physical/numerical prediction error envelope, including native arithmetic and history/grid uncertainty, yields log-likelihood and posterior/model-preference error bounds narrower than the ORIGINAL decision margins. No such bridge or required tau tolerance is present in the recovered inputs. The widths alone cannot decide adequacy. The prior conditional TV/mean/width/overlap bounds in the journal remain valid but uninstantiated. Inferring equivalence from absent qualified posteriors remains invalid.

## AKTUEL OVERLEVERING

Selected next motor: the established AUTONOMOUS RESULT INGESTION & ROUTING ENGINE. Ingest this actual component result and distinguish its scope from physical qualification. Its single material task is to determine whether any documented, accessible endpoint error contract can connect these conditional scalar bounds to Q044's frozen inference criteria. Carry the complete journal and raw component files. Do not send the same generic hull derivation back to Mathematics. Return there only with new quantitative prediction/likelihood sensitivities or a concrete counterexample requiring mathematics.

A bounded numerical qualification task may be chosen only if the missing complete-history/native-arithmetic and endpoint error requirements can actually be specified and checked without changing scientific assumptions. The stored V31 raw-node files, if later retrieved, must match their declared raw SHA256s; they may sharpen this rail-based calculation but are not required to repeat the computation already completed. No production restart is authorized by this result.

Success: an explicit adequacy/insufficiency judgment relative to documented original scientific decision margins, or a finite documented unavailability boundary. Stop repeating hash audits, generic error-budget templates, old cap32 runs, launcher tests or the same component fixtures. If no accessible material next task exists, the receiving engine may close with an honestly scoped inconclusive answer and route toMotor14; that decision has not been fabricated here. Physical Q044 remains open in this handoff.

## Preserved complete incoming SAMLET JOURNAL — verbatim historical state

# BUBBLEVERSE — RESULT INGESTION & ROUTING HANDOFF

RD OF THE UNIVERSE

## SAMLET JOURNAL — effective ingestion update

CURRENT Q: Q044. CASE ID: NOT DOCUMENTED. STATUS: CONTINUES.
RESULT-ID: R-Q044-INGESTION-001.
EXACT QUESTION: Under the original Q041 matched-data and prior contract, does the CamSpec–HiLLiPoP implementation difference produce a material difference in H0 constraints or the n_scf = 3 EDE-versus-ΛCDM conclusion once numerical prediction accuracy and posterior convergence are qualified, or is the downstream result equivalent or conditional on the external dataset combination?

This is the same authoritative attached journal updated differentially. The complete incoming 168,679-byte Q044 journal is retained verbatim below. These effective entries govern current routing; older instructions remain historical. The complete supplied 91-source register, claim-map trees, later source additions, code/output and prior case records survive. No separately missing global master journal is reconstructed.

### J-044-16 — Ingestion and qualification boundary

[TECHNICAL VALIDATION] All five attachments match recorded hashes; the decision's three declared delivery hashes agree. Four embedded JSON blocks parse. The original 91 source IDs are unique and both inherited map trees remain intact. Seven reported offline resolver outcomes are internally consistent; they were not independently rerun in this ingestion. Accept I-Q044-EXECUTION-QUALIFICATION-001 as scoped design, native-source and local-control evidence. Do not promote it to an implemented support hull, complete physical reference or cosmological result.

### J-044-17 — New structural direction and anti-loop check

[DERIVED CONDITIONAL STRUCTURE / ROUTING INFERENCE] At fixed valid conformal-time knots, native estimated-derivative endpoint formulas are linear in supplied ordinates. The real-arithmetic spline solve and declared integral therefore define a support-specific linear functional T_N(y)=a_N^T y. Its exact range over an independent ordinate box is obtained by sign-selected endpoints of each term. Prefix-dependent coefficients, uncertain knots, shared correlations and original-binary rounding must remain separately accounted for. No weights, measured width or tau enclosure were computed here.

The selected next engine is the operator-established AUTONOMOUS MATHEMATICS ENGINE, with one narrowed support-functional sensitivity/enclosure task. This supersedes the earlier immediate generic instruction to instantiate all missing qualification categories at once. No repeated TV proof, generic missing-reference report, hash audit, launcher retest or unchanged historical numerical run is selected. The new task must yield a new bound or a concrete candidate obstruction.

### J-044-18 — Current repository provenance and controls

[TECHNICAL SOURCE RECHECK] Connected GitHub branch refs are unchanged: execution72cf9e92fc794c122f593a77b6a555e6e97f6a2e; modeldd7575e7146382957d206e87274ca6246c2587b7. Original V29 artifact metadata lists two unexpired products at the original execution SHA. Metadata alone does not validate their contents; no artifact bytes were downloaded here. The local prepared README/registry and stale remote state remain separate. No remote write, workflow dispatch or numerical production occurred.

### J-044-19 — Completion, anomalies and journal delta

Q-COMPLETION_GATE=NOT_YET_SATISFIED. The exact original downstream question has no qualified materiality/equivalence/dataset-conditional verdict. A specific unassessed support-functional route can still materially affect numerical qualification. A template/blocker certificate alone does not settle the question; an inconclusive closure remains legitimate if the bounded new task demonstrates no specific accessible materially informative path remains.

KEEP all physical parameters/candidates, H0 benchmark gaps, Q035–Q043 boundaries, open portability predictions and C-036-IMPL=OPEN_NARROWED. No new anomaly, H0, model preference or physical falsification is inferred. ADD I-Q044-INGESTION-001 and I-Q044-REPOSITORY-RECHECK-001 plus C-Q044-I01–I05 source mappings. REFINE current next action only. PRODUCTION_RESTART_AUTHORIZED=false. NEXT ENGINE=AUTONOMOUS MATHEMATICS ENGINE.

Assembly time: 2026-10-09T15:03:42.063378+02:00 / 2026-10-09T13:03:42.063378+00:00.

# BUBBLEVERSE — RESULT INGESTION & ROUTING HANDOFF

Date and time: 2026-10-09T15:03:42.063378+02:00 (Europe/Copenhagen); 2026-10-09T13:03:42.063378+00:00 (UTC).

STATUS: CONTINUES
CASE ID: NOT DOCUMENTED
CURRENT Q: Q044 — preserved operator-proposed scientific identifier; remote canonical registration not performed.

QUESTION:
Under the original Q041 matched-data and prior contract, does the CamSpec–HiLLiPoP implementation difference produce a material difference in H0 constraints or the n_scf = 3 EDE-versus-ΛCDM conclusion once numerical prediction accuracy and posterior convergence are qualified, or is the downstream result equivalent or conditional on the external dataset combination?

This is the exact original operator-supplied question. Shorter formulations in historical Q044 files are retained as historical summaries, not replacements.

## RECOMMENDED CHATGPT EXECUTION PROFILE

Available capabilities: Work/Codex file and Python access, connected GitHub file/branch/run/artifact retrieval, web/primary-source research, Library delivery and parallel-agent facilities. No agents were spawned. The exposed candidate catalogue includes GPT-6.1 Sol, GPT-6 Astra, GPT-6 Sol, GPT-5.6 Sol and GPT-6 Luna; it does not establish the operator's complete selector, current exact model/reasoning, context limits, usage limits or comparative mathematical reliability.

Recommended model/mode: a strong mathematical reasoning configuration in Work/Codex; GPT-6.1 Sol with High reasoning if selectable. Recommended style: focused autonomous derivation plus bounded source/file analysis. Class C with relevant Class E tools under this ingestion prompt's capability taxonomy. Fallback: strongest equivalent available reasoning configuration. Escalate only if prefix-dependent linear algebra, joint uncertainty or switched-equation assumptions exceed its reliable scope. ASTRA MAX is not assumed available or automatically superior.

Recommended tools: pinned GitHub/native-source access and local symbolic/exact or outward-rounded calculation. Optional: targeted primary numerical-analysis sources if a specific theorem or rounding bound is needed. Generic cosmology searches, extra model comparisons and production compute add no current qualification evidence and are not selected.

## SELECTED NEXT BUBBLEVERSE ENGINE

BUBBLEVERSE — THE AUTONOMOUS MATHEMATICS ENGINE.

Exactly one scientific destination. The engine is established by the operator's full Mathematics Engine prompt in this session. It is not inferred from an unverified repository filename or invented as a new motor. Consistency checks are part of its task, not a second routing destination.

## SAMLET JOURNAL

The complete updated authoritative journal is delivered individually as Q044_SAMLET_JOURNAL.md. It includes this ingestion/routing decision and the entire 168,679-byte incoming journal byte-for-byte, including the original 91-source register, both complete inherited claim-map trees, later Q044 source records, proofs, synthetic check code/output and historical Q043 record. A full global master journal beyond the supplied cumulative record remains NOT RECOVERED; this gap is preserved, not repaired by invention.

## NEW RESULT

Received result ID: I-Q044-EXECUTION-QUALIFICATION-001.
Ingestion result ID: R-Q044-INGESTION-001.
Origin: Autonomous Execution-Mechanism / Numerical / HPC / Motor-Builder Engine.
Result classes: TECHNICAL DESIGN / SOURCE RESULT / CONDITIONAL MATHEMATICAL RESULT / LOCAL VALIDATION RESULT.
Result status: ACCEPTED WITH SCOPE LIMITS. Received control tests are TECHNICALLY VALIDATED locally; the new support representation is UNIMPLEMENTED and scientific inference UNQUALIFIED.

DIRECT OUTPUT: All five received file hashes match the prior documented delivery and the decision's three declared control/protocol hashes. No new cosmological result is contained in them. The recorded seven offline resolver cases have the expected accept/reject outcomes. Their script was not independently rerun during ingestion. Current GitHub branch refs still match the received execution/model pins. Two V29 artifacts are listed, unexpired, at the original execution SHA. Their bytes were not downloaded in this ingestion.

TECHNICAL INTERPRETATION: The protocol and blocker certificate are usable for defining a new qualification component. The pair of local control files retires V29 correctly within its documented scope; it has not been installed remotely. A support hull can avoid retaining every support interval in the final output, but it does not automatically improve width, runtime, complete-history coverage or prediction accuracy. Support-dependent spline coefficients prevent unproved reuse of a single common-spline prefix sum.

PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION: No material H0 shift, EDE preference, equivalence, dataset dependence or physical causality has been established. Scientific hypotheses and the observed implementation-geometry discrepancy retain their previous states. Technical failure is not physical falsification; compact output is not an accuracy certificate.

ANOMALY STATUS: C-036-IMPL remains OPEN_NARROWED; its causal origin and downstream significance are unresolved. The legacy-plus versus exact-cubic-minus functional distinction is a preserved known technical discrepancy, not newly discovered physics. No new scientific anomaly is declared.

## INTERNAL RESULT PROVENANCE

Incoming assembly: 2026-10-09T12:51:49.966136+00:00.

V29 run37362125253, attempt1, is inherited completed/success technical evidence. Native MPFR version256-bit arithmetic uses MPFR4.2.1 in V29's frozen contract; it is not a declaration of a new runtime execution here.
PROGRAM_ID: NONE NEW. Workflow dispatch, new integration, new posterior/optimizer calculation and production restart: NONE. Remote mutation: NONE. Hardware/compiler/solver for a new numerical result: NOT APPLICABLE.

## WEB / PLUGIN / TOOL RESEARCH

Research performed: YES — targeted technical provenance verification only.
Capabilities: connected GitHub branch-ref and workflow-artifact metadata; local attached-file hashing/JSON/source inspection. One artifact-tool call initially used the wrong repository argument and returned an argument-binding error; the corrected call succeeded. The failure created no result.
Questions: Do the input files match? Has a newer repository state superseded their pins? Are original V29 artifacts still listed? Does the proposed next step repeat old work?
New external cosmological evidence: NONE. New measurement/independent scientific replication: NONE. Artifact metadata establishes listing/retention/declared digest, not archive contents or scientific validity.
Contradictory evidence: NONE NEW. The prepared COMPLETED registry and stale remote ACTIVE registry are different deployment states, not conflicting cosmological observations.
Impact: retain all science; refine next action to a specific support-functional sensitivity calculation rather than repeat a general qualification template or reopen Q042.

## ACTIVE SOURCE REGISTER AND CLAIM MAP

All inherited source objects and claim maps remain inside the same journal. Necessary active records include:

- I-Q044-CONTRACT-001 and I-Q042-TREATMENT-003: original internal scientific contract, q042_production_spec_v1.json; SHA256 41e4d8f026933f64dbe41048f894002f479ba2b504432b33dc155f4dfe71378c. Supports unchanged 20-cell design and decision rules.

Metadata only, not a fresh byte audit.

Current mappings:
C-Q044-I01 (received result is a scoped design/control result) → I-Q044-EXECUTION-QUALIFICATION-001, I-Q044-CONTROL-001, I-Q044-INGESTION-001.
C-Q044-I02 (no qualified scientific comparison exists in received evidence) → I-Q044-MATH-QUALIFICATION-001, I-Q044-EXECUTION-QUALIFICATION-001 and preserved Q041/Q042 failures.
C-Q044-I03 (support-functional sensitivity is a distinct material next task) → I-Q044-NATIVE-SUPPORT-001, K-Q042-INGESTDESIGN-001, I-Q044-INGESTION-001; status ROUTING INFERENCE / CONDITIONAL MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURE.
C-Q044-I04 (remote pins unchanged; V29 artifacts listed) → I-Q044-REPOSITORY-RECHECK-001.
C-Q044-I05 (complete supplied journal/source/map continuity) → input journal hash and exact suffix preservation in I-Q044-INGESTION-001.

## WHAT CHANGED / WHAT DID NOT CHANGE

ADD acceptance with explicit scope, current metadata, and a narrower next task. REFINE the earlier generic instruction to instantiate all missing qualification prerequisites at once. That instruction is SUPERSEDED for immediate routing, not deleted.
KEEP exact Q, physical model/prior/data definitions, thresholds, H0 benchmarks and bibliographic gaps, active candidates, unresolved predictions and geometry tension. Q042 stays CLOSED INCONCLUSIVE; Q043's original local-only result stays historical. Q044 remains scientifically OPEN.

## FALSIFIED / REJECTED / SUPERSEDED MATERIAL

Preserve all prior exclusions: Q040 invalid endpoints; Q041 V19 as a substitute for the full contract; classifier labels as invariant modes; unchanged V31 completion-by-time-alone; retroactive cap enlargement; partial records as complete histories; diagnostic references as qualified scientific truth; finite-start flags as global minima; cross-arm absolute chi2 arithmetic; timeout as physical falsification. No new hypothesis is falsified by this ingestion.

## OPEN UNCERTAINTIES AND Q-COMPLETION GATE

STATUS: NOT YET SATISFIED.
The exact downstream question has neither qualified 20-cell results nor demonstrated operational equivalence. Four missing categories remain: complete history/input/switch coverage; support-functional error bounds; observable/native-likelihood/domain/tail transport; sampling/optimizer qualification.

An INCONCLUSIVE closure is legitimate when the remaining evidence cannot support further material progress. It is not selected merely because an unexecuted candidate is difficult. Here a specific new mathematical route remains: exploit fixed-grid linearity without pretending different supports share their coefficients. Its ability to produce useful bounds has not been assessed. Its answer can materially change whether a qualified comparison is feasible and hence the downstream verdict. Completion of a template and launcher tests does not close the original scientific Q.

## MATERIAL-REVERSAL TEST / ANTI-LOOP DECISION

PASS for the next task only. Repeating source hashes, seven resolver tests, posterior TV proofs, generic literature surveys or unchanged V26–V31 runs is not selected. The next result must provide a new support-dependent functional sensitivity/enclosure or a specific failure of that candidate; another generic list of missing references is insufficient information gain.

## NEXT TASK — ONE BOUNDED MATHEMATICAL COMPONENT

Determine whether support-specific linear functionals can provide a rigorous and usefully tighter tau-functional hull under the frozen native semantics, without requiring storage of every support interval or using unproved common-spline coefficients.

For a fixed valid conformal-time grid and each distinct N, use the native estimated-derivative boundary conditions to derive the real-arithmetic linear operator M_N=B_N y. Then the declared native-plus or separately identified exact-cubic-minus functional has T_N(y)=a_N^T y. Prefix dependence remains in B_N and a_N. For independently bounded ordinates y_i∈[l_i,u_i] and exact weights, extrema of that linear functional over the box are sums of sign-selected endpoints. Correlations make this a conservative box bound; exploiting them requires justified joint constraints. Uncertain grid/coefficients and original-binary rounding require separate outward bounds. This is a prospective structural route, not a currently computed weight vector or tau enclosure.

Recover original V29 grid/context from existing archived products if needed, verify recorded hashes, and reuse V31 node/candidate/rail evidence where its actual bytes are available. Do not replace missing nodes with point guesses. If V31 raw products are unavailable, report exact missing paths/hashes, and distinguish an algebraic component result from an uncomputed physical-data hull. Published archive metadata alone is not enough to claim recovered numerical inputs.

Deliver: declared target functional; support-specific weight/enclosure derivation; finite independent checks appropriate to that component; actual conditional hull/width and uncertainty-source decomposition if valid inputs permit; otherwise a finite unsupported-input/candidate-failure certificate. State whether its precision is assessed against a justified tau-to-observable/likelihood requirement. If that requirement remains absent, mark INFERENCE ADEQUACY UNDETERMINED; do not invent a tolerance or equate compactness with accuracy.

## FIXED / FROZEN ELEMENTS

Q044 and exact question; full journal/source IDs; original matched 20 cells; native nuisance treatment; physical models; priors; external datasets; source commits; support candidate admissibility; excluded final row; i=0 and N=max(3,i) behavior; decreasing eta orientation; original plus-sign functional identity; all frozen scientific decision thresholds; no production authorization.

## VARIABLE ELEMENTS

New numerical representation and mathematical elimination/adjoint method only, with explicit new lineage. Error-allocation and rounding method may be proposed prospectively with justification. No physical equation, dataset, prior, endpoint or threshold is changed to obtain a desired category.

## SUCCESS / FAILURE / STOP CONDITIONS

SUCCESS: a source-matched support-dependent operator and validated bound, with explicit actual-data applicability and a defensible adequacy assessment or clearly bounded remaining transport dependency. It is a component success, not by itself a scientific Q044 result.
FAILURE: a demonstrated source mismatch, invalid coefficient/grid bound, missing indispensable raw input, or proven inadequate width under a stated justified requirement. Preserve the result and its tested scope. Candidate failure does not establish universal impossibility or model falsification.
STOP THIS COMPONENT: when the new bound/width or a concrete obstruction is documented; return to ingestion without an automatic precision ladder, new integration or production restart.
STOP Q044 AND SEND TO MOTOR14: when qualified results answer the unchanged scientific question, or a defensible scoped INCONCLUSIVE outcome is documented and no specific accessible remaining task is reasonably likely to materially alter it. Preserve open portability predictions even if Q044 closes inconclusively. A future materially new qualified reference/representation may support a future investigation; it is not evidence already obtained.

## Complete incoming Q044 journal — preserved historical accumulated record

# BUBBLEVERSE — OVERLEVERING

RD OF THE UNIVERSE

Date and time verified at assembly: 2026-10-09T12:51:49.966136+00:00 (UTC).

CURRENT Q: Q044. STATUS: CONTINUES / SCIENTIFIC ANSWER UNRESOLVED.
CURRENT STAGE: EXECUTION-MECHANISM DECISION AND PROSPECTIVE REFERENCE-ACCURACY QUALIFICATION.
RESULT-ID: I-Q044-EXECUTION-QUALIFICATION-001.
NEXT DESTINATION: RESULT INGESTION & ROUTING, retaining Q044; next scientific work belongs to the existing Mathematics/Consistency Engine.

## SAMLET JOURNAL — effective differential update

This is the same authoritative supplied journal, updated differentially. The entire incoming Q044 journal is retained byte-for-byte below as historical accumulated state; its complete 91-source register and both inherited claim-map trees remain present. The effective entries here and the embedded current protocol supersede earlier next-engine/current-head/control instructions only where stated. No missing global master journal is recreated.

### J-044-12 — Execution decision

[TECHNICAL RESULT] The smallest current mechanism is the existing Mathematics/Consistency Motor plus pinned repository retrieval. A prospective qualification protocol and finite blocker certificate have been completed. They are not an instantiated executable numerical campaign: no complete qualified history, observable/native-likelihood transport, support/tail certificate or sampling/optimizer error input has been established. No new motor, PROGRAM_ID, workflow, production run or cosmological result was created. Q044 remains OPEN, and production_restart_authorized=false.

### J-044-13 — Native support representation

[SOURCE VERIFIED / DERIVED CONDITIONAL DESIGN] Pinned native source independently confirms strict first-minimum selection excluding the final native row; i=0 gives zero; otherwise N=max(3,i) uses rows0..N−1. Estimated spline endpoint derivatives and coefficients depend on N. A fixed-spline prefix accumulator cannot silently replace the native support computations. A hull of all separately valid support-specific functional intervals preserves their coverage and can use compact final storage. This new representation is not implemented or qualified, does not reproduce V31, and establishes neither useful precision nor runtime nor physical feasibility. Its naive work is O(sum N), not automatically O(n).

[SOURCE VERIFIED] Native arrays.c uses plus-curvature integration, whereas the mathematical integral of its usual cubic spline has minus-curvature. These must be separate declared targets. No operator/sign replacement or native binary replay occurred. The previously documented V31 sign/arithmetic audit remains inherited.

### J-044-14 — Current repository/control evidence

[VERIFIED BRANCH REFS] Execution main=72cf9e92fc794c122f593a77b6a555e6e97f6a2e; model main=dd7575e7146382957d206e87274ca6246c2587b7. Accepted model remains v0.4/R000004 through Q042, production false. Earlier head observations retain their time-specific provenance.

[VERIFIED TECHNICAL COMPLETION] GitHub run37362125253 attempt1 is completed/success at the execution pin. This supports V29 COMPLETED_PREREQUISITE_ONLY, not a qualified reference. The live registry still calls V29 ACTIVE and README still directs its launch at the inspected pin. Paired local registry/README corrections are prepared; only the V29 registry entry changes. Immutable manifest and launcher stay unchanged. Seven offline executions of the actual launcher resolver pass expected outcomes: completed V29/V28, unknown identifier, unsafe identifier, invalid Q and unsafe workflow are rejected; one isolated ACTIVE fixture is accepted. No gh dispatch step is executed. Gates PASS only for this local control scope; remote remains unpatched.

### J-044-15 — Journal effect, evidence and next task

KEEP all scientific/hypothesis/parameter/prediction/contradiction states and rejected endpoints. ADD the protocol, finite unsupported-input certificate and local control evidence. UPDATE current repository observations and effective next action. Scientific evidence remains INSUFFICIENT for Q044. No H0 shift, tau, posterior, contour overlap or EDE preference is calculated here. No universal impossibility is inferred.

New source IDs: I-Q044-EXECUTION-QUALIFICATION-001 (protocol and blocker certificate); I-Q044-NATIVE-SUPPORT-001 (native thermodynamics.c and arrays.c at pinned CLASS source); I-Q044-CONTROL-001 (verified completion receipt, paired local correction and offline resolver tests). All are mathematical/technical lineage, not independent cosmological observations. Exact upstream hashes match the inherited source lock. All existing source IDs stay unchanged.

NEXT REQUIRED ACTION: ingest this bounded result, then instantiate the earliest missing qualified original-context history/input and support-specific functional prerequisite using the existing motor. Numerical/HPC implementation becomes appropriate when an exact component target, valid inputs, prospective budget and finite result tests exist. Do not repeat old acquisitions merely to fill a workflow or launch production under stale metadata.

## Current complete execution protocol

# BUBBLEVERSE — Q044 EXECUTION DECISION AND QUALIFICATION PROTOCOL

RD OF THE UNIVERSE

Status: DESIGN COMPLETE; FULL REFERENCE/INFERENCE QUALIFICATION BLOCKED.
Scientific Q044 remains OPEN. This is a prospective specification and finite blocker certificate, not production clearance or a qualified cosmological result.

## A–D. Identity, setting, capabilities and mechanism

CURRENT Q: Q044, operator-proposed scientific continuation. Historical registry identifiers Q-042 remain unchanged. No canonical Q044 allocation or repository registration has been performed.

QUESTION: Under the original matched-data/prior contract, does the CamSpec–HiLLiPoP implementation difference materially change qualified H0 constraints or n_scf=3 EDE-versus-LCDM conclusions, or is the effect non-material under the frozen criteria or dataset conditional?

RECOMMENDED CHATGPT SETTING: strong reasoning in Work/Codex with repository and mathematical tools; GPT-6.1 Sol with High reasoning if selectable. Exact active variant/reasoning and the operator's selector are not verified. GPT-6 Astra and GPT-5.6 Sol are exposed delegation candidates, not proof of account-specific ASTRA MAX availability or comparative reliability. Use the strongest available extended setting if coupled switched-history proofs and observable transport exceed the bounded current task. Fallback: equivalent deep reasoning with file, code and source access. No model switch was performed.

CAPABILITIES USED: connected GitHub for pinned files, branch refs and V29 run receipt; local file/code tools for bounded control validation; Library for delivery. Retrieval is an access mechanism, not independent physical evidence. No broad literature survey, deployment tool or production compute is needed for this decision.

EXECUTION MODE: EXISTING MATHEMATICS/CONSISTENCY MOTOR + REPOSITORY RETRIEVAL. It is sufficient to deliver this bounded qualification design and blocker certificate. No new motor, cosmological program, sampler, workflow or PROGRAM_ID is needed now. Future component qualification requires genuine numerical code after its input and reference contract are instantiated; future inference requires qualified production and separate authorization.

## E–H. Scientific requirement, continuity and sources

Preserve the original 20 cells: CamSpec and HiLLiPoP; LCDM and n_scf=3 EDE; FULL, NO_ACT_PRIMARY, NO_ACT_LENSING, NO_DESI_DR2, NO_SN. Preserve native nuisance treatment, matched priors, ACT DR6 primary/lensing, DESI DR2 and frozen Pantheon+ likelihood. Preserve every threshold and completeness gate in J-044-02 of SAMLET JOURNAL. No covariance-adjusted replacement of the frozen descriptive D index is permitted. No cross-arm absolute-objective subtraction is permitted.

Scientific-contract SHA256: 41e4d8f026933f64dbe41048f894002f479ba2b504432b33dc155f4dfe71378c.
Source-lock SHA256: 0f973de56cc232e67b37839babadbe192bab4a4c58e0102bee98c48a2106df56.
Execution repository pin: Morfindien/Bubbleverse@72cf9e92fc794c122f593a77b6a555e6e97f6a2e.
Model branch-ref pin inspected this stage: Morfindien/bubbleverse-model@dd7575e7146382957d206e87274ca6246c2587b7. Its accepted model remains v0.4/R000004 through Q042, production_restart_authorized=false. This supersedes earlier current-head observations, not their historical facts.
Native CLASS source pin: mwt5345/class_ede@5a131c91d657dd9a7c6364cc45b038710f8d0d97.

Inherited source IDs remain unchanged: EVD-Q041-QJOURNAL-PDF; I-Q042-COMPARISON-V31-001; I-Q042-COMPARISON-V31-VALIDATION-001; I-Q042-V31-INGESTION-001; I-Q044-MATH-QUALIFICATION-001 and the complete historical register/maps inside SAMLET JOURNAL. The current stage adds I-Q044-EXECUTION-QUALIFICATION-001 (this specification), I-Q044-NATIVE-SUPPORT-001 (pinned native source inspection), I-Q044-CONTROL-001 (local control patch and checks). These are technical/mathematical evidence, not new external observations.

KEEP Q035–Q043 results, excluded endpoints, unresolved portability/H0 predictions, model candidates and benchmark source gaps. ADD this design and blocker certificate. UPDATE effective repository observations. No physical parameters, hypothesis status or numerical scientific result change.

## I. Repository search and reuse decision

| Material | Decision | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| q042_context_v29.py, native capture, interval evaluator, source checks, contract and manifest | REUSE/REFERENCE ONLY | Frozen context and finite interval prerequisites; not a validated trajectory |
| V26 reference-acquisition contract and V27/V28 diagnostics | REFERENCE ONLY | Raw lineage and failures; do not relaunch |
| V31 functional-cap certificate/checks in accepted model | REFERENCE ONLY | Partial-history, representation-specific cap failure; V31 source/raw products not recovered remotely here |
| Native thermodynamics.c and tools/arrays.c | REFERENCE ONLY | Exact support selection, prefix-dependent spline and legacy functional semantics |
| q042_production_spec_v1.json and source lock | REUSE unchanged | Scientific definitions; not production-ready accuracy |
| 00-bubbleverse-start.yml | UNCHANGED | Exact registry lookup; rejects non-ACTIVE identifiers |
| bubbleverse_program_registry.json | PATCH, local prepared | Mark completed V29 inactive using verified run receipt |
| README.md | PATCH, local prepared | Replace stale active/pending V29 instructions and distinguish closed Q042 from open portability science |

V29 run 37362125253, attempt1: completed/success at the pinned execution commit. The historical manifest's ACTIVE value is retained unchanged. A mutable registry correction does not rewrite its frozen execution identity. Remote README/registry remain unmodified until this paired local patch is installed. Do not apply it over newer files without rechecking the two base Git blobs: README c17bb9ce499561d02240a7a136ede6a862ae2667; registry fae212b90ccc6509f6c4193d041cd02897334d96.

## J. Prospective numerical specification

### 1. Reference target and change firewall

Before implementing a reference, declare which object is being enclosed: original binary behavior, real-equation history under its frozen switches, the native discrete tau functional, or the continuum optical-depth integral. These are different objects. Publish both computational lineage and all changed operators. Matching two discretizations is a diagnostic; it is not reference truth.

V29's MPFR256 real-equation boxes treat binary64 constants as exact inputs. They do not enclose original binary math automatically, initial/background error, all physical parameter points, or complete histories. Its finite temperature/hydrogen boxes are not an invariant-domain proof. Original switches, frozen helium residual/cutoff, phase and flags must be retained or any change explicitly assessed as an unqualified new lineage.

Required reference product: complete time-domain/history enclosure with propagated initial/background uncertainty; inclusion/existence and uniqueness or explicit set-valued solution treatment at all active switches; accepted event and interpolation handling; validated node/observable errors; documented parameter/nuisance-domain coverage or exact/approximate posterior tail bounds. No fabricated H0 prior range or missing covariance is allowed.

### 2. Candidate compressed support representation — formal design only

For eligible native rows i=0,...,n−2, let electron-fraction enclosures be X_i=[l_i,u_i]. Define m=min_i u_i and conservative candidate set S={i:l_i<=m}. Strict native comparison picks the first equal minimum; S safely overincludes ties. The actual minimum belongs to S because its lower endpoint cannot exceed the smallest upper endpoint. Preserve the excluded final row and full native order: increasing z, decreasing conformal time eta.

Native source semantics: i=0 gives tau=0. Otherwise N=max(3,i), spline and integration use rows0,...,N−1; they do not include row N. The support map is therefore not a physical endpoint substitution. Recompute `_SPLINE_EST_DERIV_` coefficients M^(N) for each distinct N; the final derivative boundary depends on N. A single fixed-spline prefix accumulator is invalid unless a separate proof establishes equivalence.

For every N, compute a directed interval J_N enclosing the SAME declared functional using all coefficient/input errors. Return H=[min_N lower(J_N), max_N upper(J_N)], adding [0,0] if i=0 is admissible. Keep candidate count, distinct support count, endpoint witnesses, complete input/support digest and coverage certificate. Every allowed functional value is in H by union containment. Correlations may enlarge H; they cannot justify shrinking it. Missing supports, incomplete history or failed coefficient bounds make the gate fail; an empty set is an error.

This replaces the storage of many output intervals with one conservative hull. It does not reproduce frozen V31 or repair that run retrospectively. It removes an output-cardinality requirement in a NEW representation, conditional on valid J_N. It neither reduces their evaluation cost automatically nor proves useful accuracy. Straight independent coefficient solves cost O(sum_N N), at most O(n^2) over all supports; auxiliary spline memory is O(max N). The final hull is two scalar endpoints plus metadata. More efficient shared recurrences would require separate proof. No actual J_N, H or tau was computed here.

Native arrays.c uses the PLUS-curvature segment expression h(y_i+y_{i+1})/2 + h^3(M_i+M_{i+1})/24, followed by the thermodynamics minus sign for decreasing eta. The exact mathematical integral of the usual cubic spline is the corresponding MINUS-curvature expression. The latter is a distinct diagnostic/reference object; silently changing the sign would not preserve original binary behavior. Frozen V31 arithmetic/sign audit remains inherited; no new physical falsification is inferred from this source inspection.

### 3. History → observables → native likelihood

For each original cell, list every consumed observable (including spectra, lensing and background/distance products), its units, transformations, likelihood normalization and parameter/nuisance support. Bound transport of initial, background, history, event, spline, root and floating-point errors into that complete vector. Use verified remainder/sensitivity bounds or another justified enclosure. A finite derivative probe or tau-only comparison cannot certify the full vector.

Evaluate the actual native likelihood. Only for a justified fixed positive-definite Gaussian covariance use |delta logL|<=v*u+u^2/2, with u=||C^(-1/2)delta t|| and v=||C^(-1/2)(D−t)||. Variable covariance/normalization and nonlinear marginalization require their own terms. Treat shared systematic/implementation errors jointly; do not assume data-block or arm independence.

Populate the journal's log-likelihood oscillation w, absolute objective error b, support/tail and sampling-summary/bin-mass errors. Use TV<=tanh(w/4), bounded-support mean/width bounds and three-grid overlap bounds exactly as J-044-05–08 specify. Absolute likelihood offsets matter for within-arm model preference even when posterior oscillation is zero. Preserve the four-start operational statistic; a globality claim needs a separate optimizer-gap certificate.

### 4. Prospective selection and blinding

Before exposing scientific arm differences, freeze parameter/nuisance-domain coverage, seed/point selection, numerical reference method, budget allocations, confidence/coverage conventions for sampling errors, refinement schedule, and stop/failure rules. Exact numerical budget values, test-point list and justified domain/tail evidence are NOT ESTABLISHED. This is a protocol template, not a fully instantiated execution preregistration.

Use component diagnostics without arm-comparison results to construct error envelopes. Refine only under the frozen rule; never choose tolerances or omit cells because the preferred scientific category fails. Certify a frozen predicate only when its whole interval lies on the appropriate side of its unchanged threshold. Straddling/equality ambiguity or the non-exhaustive frozen classifier may remain UNRESOLVED/NOT_AVAILABLE. Failure to detect materiality does not establish equivalence.

## K–N. Registration, runtime and jobs

PROGRAM_ID: NOT APPLICABLE — no new executable campaign.
PROGRAM_ID REGISTERED: NO. No target workflow was created or dispatched. No START THIS instruction applies.
Launcher: unchanged 🚀 BUBBLEVERSE START at .github/workflows/00-bubbleverse-start.yml. V29 must be rejected after the prepared completion patch; do not restart it through stale metadata or direct dispatch.

No numerical runtime/evaluation/memory estimate is defensible without a complete validated history method and frozen reference inputs. Current GitHub hard limits are therefore not used to size a fictitious job. Single-job numerical risk: UNKNOWN. No production job/shard/checkpoint/merge exists in this design. For future independent supports, shard certified N sets and merge hull endpoints only after exact support completeness/hash checks; for stateful histories checkpoint the actual integrator enclosure/event/config state and preserve genuine continuity. Measure component runtimes and verify then-current official runner limits before registering a real campaign.

## O–Q. Finite test plan and control files

| Gate | Required evidence | Current state |
|---|---|---|
| Q/contract continuity | Full journal and original contract/source hashes | PASS for recovered relevant record; global master journal gap inherited |
| Native support semantics | Pinned row selection, prefix-dependent boundary and functional identity | SOURCE VERIFIED; implementation not built |

No additional test campaign is triggered merely by this design. This finite plan is mandatory when the corresponding component/inference execution exists. Diagnostic completion must remain distinct from qualification and scientific result gates.

FILE DECISIONS: CREATE this protocol and machine-readable blocker result. UPDATE the same authoritative SAMLET JOURNAL. PATCH paired README.md and bubbleverse_program_registry.json locally. UNCHANGED launcher, all native/program/contracts and historical manifests. No archive.

README_ACTION: UPDATE, local prepared. README_GATE and REPOSITORY_CONSISTENCY_GATE can pass for the paired local control correction only; remote status remains stale until installed. They do not certify the entire historical repository or science.

## R–W. Complete existing-motor invocation and return route

Use the existing MATHEMATICS/CONSISTENCY ENGINE; this is its complete focused invocation, not a new engine:

1. Read this protocol and the entire attached updated SAMLET JOURNAL. Freeze Q044 and the exact scientific question. Preserve the complete inherited source register and claim maps; use KEEP/ADD/UPDATE actions, never regenerate history from the latest result.
2. Retrieve the exact missing reference inputs and their hashes using relevant connected capabilities. Record underlying sources and dependency scope. Do not assume raw diagnostics are true histories or replace frozen source versions.
3. Instantiate the earliest blocked gate before downstream work: complete original-context products, matching history/input uncertainty, support-specific coefficient enclosures and declared target functional. Determine whether the compressed support hull can meet a prospectively selected accuracy budget. If not, give the concrete failed gate and interval width; do not broaden physical assumptions.
4. Where genuine calculation is necessary, return an actual bounded component-program specification to this execution engine with exact inputs, accepted error budgets, finite tests, runtime estimates and new-lineage identity. Register a PROGRAM_ID only once an executable target exists and the launcher/registry/README gates pass. Do not start cosmological production without qualification and separate production authorization.
5. Stop when a finite unsupported prerequisite is demonstrated or the relevant gate is qualified. No endless repeats of V26–V31, retroactive cap changes, guessed reference values or tuning to scientific results.
6. Return to RESULT INGESTION & ROUTING with Q044, the same full journal, source IDs/commits/hashes, new technical results, exact test scope, journal delta and remaining blockers. Route any genuinely qualified computation through NUMERICAL/HPC; retain Q044 throughout.

EXPECTED OUTPUTS NOW: this design; machine-readable BLOCKED certificate; updated authoritative journal; two local control replacement files. Actual scientific computed result: NOT YET COMPUTED. FINAL SCIENTIFIC RESULT GATE: UNRESOLVED. PRODUCTION RESTART AUTHORIZED: false.

Finite blocker: no complete qualified original-context history and input-error envelope, no validated observable/native-likelihood transport/domain/tail certificate, and no justified sampling/optimizer error inputs have been established in the inspected material. These missing objects prevent a qualified Q044 verdict. This is insufficient current qualification, not a theorem that computation or the physical hypothesis is impossible.

# BUBBLEVERSE — OVERLEVERING

RD OF THE UNIVERSE

Verified document assembly time: 2026-10-09T14:04:05+02:00; Europe/Copenhagen.

STATUS: CONTINUES.
Q: Q044 — proposed scientific continuation supplied by the operator; no remote canonical registration performed.
CASE-ID: NOT DOCUMENTED.
STAGE: MATHEMATICAL INFERENCE-ACCURACY QUALIFICATION DESIGN.
STAGE RECORD: I-Q044-MATH-QUALIFICATION-001; analytical framework, not a closed scientific result.
SELECTED NEXT ENGINE: BUBBLEVERSE — AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION-MECHANISM / NUMERICAL / HPC / MOTOR-BUILDER ENGINE.

## CHATGPT SETUP ASSESSMENT

Current verified capabilities: Work/Codex file access, local Python/NumPy calculation, connected read-only GitHub and Library access, primary-source web retrieval. Exact active model variant, active reasoning setting, account-specific selector, context limit and usage limits were not independently verified. No model switch was performed.

Recommended: a strong mathematical reasoning model with High or deeper reasoning in Work/Codex, retaining repository, file and computational tools; GPT-6.1 Sol with High reasoning if selectable. Capability classes H/X + A + C. The exposed candidate catalogue also names GPT-6 Astra, GPT-6 Sol, GPT-5.6 Sol and GPT-6 Luna; catalogue exposure does not verify account availability or comparative scientific accuracy. A frontier model is warranted if coupled switched-ODE stability, whole-domain enclosures or interacting solver/likelihood assumptions become intractable for the current configuration. The present bounded derivation did not require a model upgrade or parallel agents.

Fallback: strongest available deep-reasoning setup with equivalent mathematical, source and code access. A newer configuration may replace every named recommendation on capability grounds. Tools are required for pinned-contract recovery, reference qualification and reproducibility; no tool is itself evidence of physical truth.

## SAMLET JOURNAL — CURRENT EFFECTIVE STATE

This document is the single updated relevant journal for Q044. Its current entries govern the effective state. The complete supplied Q043 journal, original 91-source register and both claim-map trees are preserved below as a historical record. Its earlier accepted-v0.3 and pending-publication statements describe its original time, not current model state. The inherited record explicitly lacks a separately recovered complete global master journal; this continuation does not invent that missing material.

### J-044-01 — Scientific question and inherited boundaries

Does the CamSpec–HiLLiPoP implementation difference materially change qualified H0 constraints or the n_scf=3 EDE-versus-LCDM conclusion under the original matched-data/prior contract, or is its effect contractually non-material or dataset dependent?

[INHERITED] Q035 classifier harmonization remains valid. Q036–Q038 retain the continuous implementation-dependent fitted-geometry result without a causal or downstream cosmological interpretation. Q039 retains its negative results within frozen interventions. Q040 invalid numerical endpoints remain excluded. Q041 V19 did not qualify the original full comparison. Q042 is CLOSED with general feasibility INCONCLUSIVE, REFERENCE_TRUTH=BLOCKED and NUMERICAL_FINAL_RESULT=UNRESOLVED. Q043 established local preparation/validation only at its original closure. No investigation is restarted or renamed.

[PINNED REPOSITORY READ] At model commit 673e3d2f30eb6d1f36459d4dca3ac1fa0fb9e2ab, accepted/model_state.json records accepted v0.4/R000004 through Q042 and production_restart_authorized=false. Its blob matches the same file at the incoming 14eacce7a93e4ac780d59b1e86dc0cb9060f38ad pin. The latest commit-search result observed during this turn differs from the incoming model head. That observation is not a branch-ref verification or a complete audit of newer uploaded files. No current-head identity beyond the pinned reads is asserted.

Execution commit inspected: 72cf9e92fc794c122f593a77b6a555e6e97f6a2e. No repository write, candidate promotion, workflow dispatch, original-binary replay, cosmological prediction, optimizer start or posterior campaign occurred here. Existing model publication is separate from numerical production authorization.

Inherited physical candidates, H0 benchmarks and prediction/contradiction states remain unchanged. H0 has no single accepted value. n_scf=3 is dimensionless. The inherited benchmarks 73.50+-0.81, 67.24+-0.35 and 68.51+-0.58 km s^-1 Mpc^-1 are separate inference chains, not results calculated here. Their original primary bibliographic gaps remain. No new tension sigma was calculated from them.

### J-044-02 — Exact recovered scientific contract

[VERIFIED INPUT] q042_production_spec_v1.json is 9,024 bytes, SHA256 41e4d8f026933f64dbe41048f894002f479ba2b504432b33dc155f4dfe71378c, Git blob 9b70e5c9d62adcf43f8f48f85b7ffb628c1dd84b. This is the handoff-designated preserved original scientific contract; the filename is Q042 and it must not be silently substituted with Q041 V19's narrower execution.

Two native Planck arms times two models times five dataset combinations gives 20 cells. Preserve native CamSpec/HiLLiPoP nuisance definitions, common matched priors and physical models, FULL and NO_ACT_PRIMARY, NO_ACT_LENSING, NO_DESI_DR2 and NO_SN. The external source lock selects ACT DR6 primary with ACT ell_min=600, ACT DR6 lensing, DESI DR2 and sn.pantheonplus with runtime file-hash identity required. The ACT cutoff alone does not verify the full Planck/ACT non-overlap construction. Source-lock SHA256: 0f973de56cc232e67b37839babadbe192bab4a4c58e0102bee98c48a2106df56. Preserve the complete source lock and runtime support manifests.

Frozen scientific rules:

| Quantity | Exact rule |
|---|---|
| Parameter location | D_x=abs(mu_A-mu_B)/sqrt(sigma_A^2+sigma_B^2); material if D_H0>=1, D_fEDE>=1, or at least two eligible primary coordinates have D>=1 |
| Primary count coordinates | H0, fEDE, omega_b, omega_cdm; log10z_c/thetai_scf cannot independently trigger weakly identified EDE materiality |
| Contour statistic | Weighted common-prior 2D histogram overlap in (H0,fEDE), primary 80x80, stability 64x64 and 96x96 |
| Geometry | Material for O<0.50; substantial for O>=0.50; different sides across grids are unresolved |
| Within-arm improvement | Delta_a=chi2_LCDM,a-best - chi2_EDE,a-best |
| Preference categories | negligible: Delta<=2; modest: 2<Delta<6; substantive: Delta>=6 |
| Preference portability | Different categories AND abs(Delta_A-Delta_B)>=2 |
| Combination materiality | Preference portability material OR (parameter location material AND geometry material) |
| Robust material class | FULL and all four required valid LOO combinations material |
| Dataset conditional class | At least one required valid combination material and at least one non-material |
| Collapse class | All required valid combinations have non-material location, substantial overlap and portable preference conclusions |

D_x is the frozen descriptive portability index. Because the arms reuse Planck information, it is not automatically an independent Gaussian significance or calibrated p-value. Keep its formula; do not add a covariance term to the frozen index. Any separate inferential significance assessment would need the paired covariance and separate prospective specification.

### J-044-03 — What was already known

[INHERITED, NOT NEW DISCOVERY] The recovered Q042 V26 ingestion already defines history-to-prediction accuracy as missing and an adaptive within-arm objective interval rule. It states that sampler precision 0.001 and tau bracket setting 1e-4 are not scientific accuracy certificates. This continuation preserves that result rather than claiming to discover it again.

New work here extends the propagation to posterior location/width, all three binned-overlap grids, explicit optimizer-error accounting and the full frozen Boolean classification. It supplies conditional mathematical bounds, not numerical values for the missing accuracy budgets.

### J-044-04 — History-to-prediction-to-likelihood bridge

[DERIVED, CONDITIONAL] Let t(theta,nu) be the exact prediction vector actually consumed by a cell's native likelihood, and t_tilde its numerical approximation. theta includes cosmological coordinates; nu includes every relevant native nuisance parameter. A valid budget must cover complete history, background, initial conditions, interpolation, event handling, root solve where relevant, observable transport and likelihood evaluation. A same-spline tau comparison alone cannot bound the entire vector t.

For a fixed positive-definite Gaussian covariance C and residual r=D-t, write delta_t=t_tilde-t, u=||C^(-1/2)delta_t|| and v=||C^(-1/2)r||. Then

delta_chi2=-2*r^T*C^(-1)*delta_t+delta_t^T*C^(-1)*delta_t,
abs(delta_chi2)<=2*v*u+u^2,
abs(delta_logL)<=v*u+u^2/2.

These are exact fixed-C inequalities. Units cancel after covariance whitening. They do not justify treating every Planck, ACT, SN or other likelihood as fixed-C Gaussian. If C, likelihood normalization or marginalization changes with predictions, include those terms or evaluate the actual native likelihood with a justified enclosure. For a differentiable non-Gaussian likelihood, a bound on its gradient along the complete prediction segment yields a conditional Lipschitz bound; it cannot be assumed across an unqualified discontinuity or invalid-support region.

History/tau tolerances require independently justified sensitivity or transport bounds into t. Agreement of two solvers does not certify their shared background or physics. A finite collection of reference points establishes only their tested scope unless coverage or remainder bounds justify extension.

### J-044-05 — Posterior perturbation bound

[DERIVED] In one arm/model/combination cell, preserve the same prior, nuisance domain, support and physical likelihood. Write ell=logL, delta=ell_tilde-ell and w=ess_sup(delta)-ess_inf(delta) over the complete prior support carrying likelihood. Assume this finite bound exists and both posterior normalizers are finite and nonzero. Additive constant offsets disappear from posterior normalization.

For total variation TV(P,Q)=sup_A abs(P(A)-Q(A))=one-half the L1 density difference,

TV(p,p_tilde)<=tanh(w/4).

Proof: let R=exp(w), p=P(A). A bounded likelihood tilt permits Q(A)<=R*p/(1-p+R*p). Hence Q(A)-p<=(R-1)*p*(1-p)/(1+(R-1)*p). Its maximum at p=1/(1+sqrt(R)) is (sqrt(R)-1)/(sqrt(R)+1)=tanh(w/4). Reversing the event gives the other sign. This bound does not assume Gaussian posteriors, independent arms or weak parameter degeneracy.

If abs(delta-c)<=epsilon uniformly for an arbitrary constant c, w<=2*epsilon and TV<=tanh(epsilon/2). At w=0 the posteriors agree exactly. Missing likelihood support, solver failures or truncating a mode invalidate a whole-support assertion. If only a region Omega is qualified, require separate bounds on both exact and approximate posterior tail masses; a conservative full bound is min(1,tanh(w_Omega/4)+P(Omega^c)+Q(Omega^c)). A sampler's missing tail is not evidence that its exact tail mass is zero.

The sharp inequality and proof above are derived in this journal. Sprungk's primary paper is methodological context for posterior stability under prior/log-likelihood perturbations; no claim is made that its abstract establishes this exact bound for Bubbleverse.

### J-044-06 — Location and width error

[DERIVED, CONDITIONAL] If a reporting coordinate has a verified bounded support [L,U], R_x=U-L and full posterior TV<=v_num, then

abs(mu_tilde-mu)<=R_x*v_num,
abs(sigma_tilde-sigma)<=R_x*sqrt(v_num).

Mean bound: bounded-test-function property of TV. Width bound: a maximal coupling has disagreement probability TV, so ||X-Y||_2<=R_x*sqrt(TV); centering and the reverse triangle inequality bound the difference in standard deviations. These are conservative sufficient bounds. No H0 prior range is invented here. If support is unbounded, use justified moment/tail bounds instead. Values outside frozen histogram prior bounds cannot be silently discarded and renormalized.

Add separately qualified weighted-sampling errors for means and widths. Posterior width sigma is different from uncertainty in estimating that width. Use additive worst-case bounds unless independence and distributional assumptions justify another combination; common systematic errors are not automatically independent.

For arm means muhat_A,muhat_B with absolute errors e_muA,e_muB, and widths shat_a with errors e_sigmaa, set s_a^- = max(0,shat_a-e_sigmaa), s_a^+=shat_a+e_sigmaa. Then a conservative index interval is

D^- = max(0,abs(muhat_A-muhat_B)-e_muA-e_muB)/sqrt((s_A^+)^2+(s_B^+)^2),
D^+ = (abs(muhat_A-muhat_B)+e_muA+e_muB)/sqrt((s_A^-)^2+(s_B^-)^2).

An unqualified or zero lower denominator yields no finite useful D^+; preserve UNRESOLVED. A zero upper denominator also makes the lower expression undefined; do not divide zero by zero. Certify material D only if the whole interval is >=1 and non-material D only if the whole interval is <1. Equality conventions remain frozen. A nonzero-width interval straddling the boundary is unresolved. Boolean coordinate/count rules apply to the resulting interval predicates with the original weak-identification restrictions.

### J-044-07 — Contour overlap error

[DERIVED] For normalized bin-mass distributions on each frozen grid,

O(P_A,P_B)=sum_i min(P_Ai,P_Bi)=1-TV(P_A,P_B),
abs(O_tilde-O)<=TV(P_A,P_A_tilde)+TV(P_B,P_B_tilde).

Projection to fixed bins cannot increase TV, so the likelihood-oscillation bound controls numerical bin-mass transport. Include separately qualified finite weighted-sampling bin-mass errors e_hist,A and e_hist,B. A safe overlap bound is e_O<=v_num,A+v_num,B+e_hist,A+e_hist,B, clipped to the feasible [0,1] interval. Computing TV between a continuous posterior and discrete sampled atoms is not a valid way to estimate these e_hist quantities; compare bin probabilities on the prescribed grid.

Qualify all 64x64, 80x80 and 96x96 overlap intervals. Every grid must lie entirely on the same allowed side of 0.50. Binning agreement of noisy point estimates alone does not prove contour stability. This remains the frozen histogram endpoint; no Gaussian ellipse or different contour definition replaces it.

### J-044-08 — Model-preference error and optimizer scope

[DERIVED / EXTENDS INHERITED RULE] Let q=-2*ell and b_a,m bound the actual reported best-objective error in a cell. Within-arm improvement error obeys

abs(Delta_tilde_a-Delta_a)<=b_a,LCDM+b_a,EDE,
abs((Delta_tilde_A-Delta_tilde_B)-(Delta_A-Delta_B))<=b_A,LCDM+b_A,EDE+b_B,LCDM+b_B,EDE.

If ell has a uniform absolute error epsilon, the exact minimum of q over the same search domain changes by at most 2*epsilon. A numerical optimizer's unproved residual gap is separate: if its approximate-objective suboptimality is independently bounded by g in chi2 units, a conservative b=2*epsilon+g applies. Finite-start count, successful return flags or rhoend do not establish g or global optimality. For the frozen best-of-four operational statistic evaluated at the same fixed returned points, only the evaluation error needs propagation; that is not a proof of global physical minima.

Unknown constant log-likelihood offsets can cancel in posterior shape but still affect EDE/LCDM improvement if different between models. Retain normalization and offset identity; the oscillation-only posterior bound is insufficient for preference. No cross-arm absolute chi2 or evidence is subtracted. The four-term expression above compares two separately constructed within-arm improvements, as explicitly allowed by the contract.

Apply categories <=2, (2,6), >=6 to their full intervals and evaluate the preference-portability predicate for every admissible pair. A shared category certifies a false portability predicate even if an unnecessary difference subtest is uncertain; different singleton categories and a certified absolute difference >=2 certify true. Use safe three-valued logical propagation. Any incompletely bounded optimizer result is not silently considered exact. The frozen preference categories are operational Delta-chi2 categories, not automatically sigma significances, Bayes factors or evidence for a universally complete Hubble-tension solution.

### J-044-09 — No universal positive tolerance; full classification

[DERIVED] A decision threshold has zero guaranteed margin when the true statistic may lie arbitrarily close to it. For every positive fixed error allowance one can place a statistic on opposite sides of 1, 0.50, 2 or 6 within that allowance. Consequently no single positive CLASS tolerance, tau tolerance or likelihood tolerance universally guarantees this classification.

Prospectively freeze the method, metric, confidence/coverage conventions, error sources, domain and interval decision rule. A justified diagnostic phase may calibrate numerical error envelopes without exposing the scientific arm comparison; it does not need an already qualified reference to collect raw diagnostics. Such diagnostics remain RAW_NOT_QUALIFIED until the accuracy and scope gates pass. This avoids demanding a completed qualification before acquiring the evidence needed to test it.

An inference target TV<=v_target implies w<=4*atanh(v_target) as a sufficient whole-support condition. This is a mathematical relation, not a selected numerical target. Numerical targets and reference products are NOT DOCUMENTED here. Budget allocations must be justified prospectively. Scientific thresholds remain exactly unchanged. Adaptive numerical refinement may reduce an unresolved interval only under a frozen refinement rule; equality at a true boundary or an unqualified tail may remain unresolved indefinitely.

[VERIFIED CLASSIFIER SCOPE] The frozen overall labels are not an exhaustive dichotomy. Example: every dataset combination has material location, substantial overlap and portable preference. Each combination is non-material under the combined rule, yet the stricter collapse class fails. q042_production_v1.py correctly retains NOT_AVAILABLE in that example. Likewise geometry alone with non-material location need not satisfy collapse. Do not translate 'all combined predicates false' into equivalence or change the final rule retrospectively. A contract-supported collapse class would establish only the specified operational criteria; equivalence of every distributional or physical observable does not follow.

All 20 cells and five comparisons retain original completeness/convergence and method gates. The PolyChord termination precision 0.001 is an algorithm setting, not a calibrated error bound for these quantities. Required posterior qualification must address missed modes, weights, tails and estimation error. Preserve the four-start minimum convention without relabeling it a theorem of globality. No new sampling stopping criterion or optimizer setting was substituted.

### J-044-10 — Cross-checks actually performed

[COMPUTED, SYNTHETIC ONLY] Seed 44001; 5,000 random finite-distribution cases checked TV, bounded mean, standard-deviation and overlap inequalities. An independent two-point extremal construction saturated the TV bound at w=0.001,0.1,1,5. Another 5,000 fixed positive-definite covariance cases checked the exact Gaussian likelihood perturbation inequality. Boundary categories and four representative frozen final-classification cases passed, including the deliberate NOT_AVAILABLE example. All actual check outputs and the full Python/NumPy check code are embedded below.

The analytic proofs provide the mathematical result; the finite checks support arithmetic/counterexample detection and do not prove a cosmological accuracy bound. No current scientific comparison, new H0, measured preference, posterior width or actual overlap was calculated.

### J-044-11 — Qualification status and next task

MATHEMATICAL PROPAGATION FRAMEWORK: DERIVED AND SYNTHETICALLY CROSS-CHECKED.
ACTUAL HISTORY/PREDICTION/LIKELIHOOD ERROR ENVELOPES: NOT QUALIFIED.
MATCHED INDEPENDENT VALID REFERENCE: NOT ESTABLISHED IN INSPECTED MATERIAL.
ORIGINAL SWITCHED-RHS EXISTENCE/UNIQUENESS AND PHYSICAL EQUIVALENCE OF A CHANGED REPRESENTATION: NOT ESTABLISHED HERE.
SAMPLING AND OPTIMIZER ERROR INPUTS: NOT ESTABLISHED.
Q044 SCIENTIFIC ANSWER: UNRESOLVED.
PRODUCTION_RESTART_AUTHORIZED: false.

The V31 cap32 result is still conditional on its frozen retained-support representation and admissibility/domain/rail assumptions. These posterior bounds neither repair it nor prove another representation feasible. A materially different representation may be investigated only as a new qualified numerical lineage; its physical equations, priors, data and scientific decision rules must remain matched. An event-aware integrator or compressed validated support is a possible design direction, not an accepted candidate or an equivalence proof.

## AKTUEL OVERLEVERING — ONE NEXT ENGINE

Send Q044 and this entire journal to the AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION-MECHANISM / NUMERICAL / HPC / MOTOR-BUILDER ENGINE. This is a continuing scientific investigation, not a new repository-maintenance Q or a closed-case Motor14 handoff.

Exact next task: produce a bounded, prospectively specified REFERENCE-AND-ACCURACY QUALIFICATION design that can populate w, b, support/tail, posterior-summary and bin-mass error inputs above under the unchanged 20-cell contract. Reuse the existing architecture; recover frozen model/nuisance/prior/data definitions and original valid/raw products rather than starting the historical cases over.

Required deliverable:

1. One physically justified source/solver interpretation and materially different numerical representation if needed; define switched-event semantics and accepted/rejected-step behavior explicitly. No clipping, smoothing, arbitrary cutoff change, retroactive cap change or wholesale physics replacement is justified here.
2. Exact matched full-parameter/nuisance reference identities and complete histories/background/prediction/likelihood products when accessible. Their independent validity, uncertainty and coverage must be assessed. A synthetic reference, unconverged posterior mean or successful finite startup is insufficient.
3. A reference acquisition route with diagnostic identity/method gates and prospective resource/stop policy. Raw evidence may be acquired before inference qualification; its scope and required authorization must be explicit. The receiving engine must not treat this handoff as authority to dispatch a production or spectra/likelihood campaign.
4. Actual or defensible bounded transport from history/background to every consumed observable and native likelihood, plus same-model support coverage or explicit tails. Propagate reference uncertainty, floating-point/interpolation error and changed-source error separately.
5. A predeclared simultaneous error/coverage scheme for all required posterior means, widths and histogram grids, and an honest optimizer scope. The scheme must control the family of decisions rather than stacking unspecified individual confidence intervals. Confidence level is NOT SELECTED here; no observed results may be used to choose favorable scientific rules.
6. A concrete READY_FOR_SEPARATE_QUALIFICATION_EXECUTION design or a finite BLOCKED certificate naming the exact unsupported input. A READY design is not a qualified physical reference or production clearance.

After reference/accuracy evidence is available, apply the interval predicates and original five-combination rule. Only qualified production can eventually answer material difference, contract-supported collapse, dataset conditional behavior or insufficient qualification. No unavoidable Q044 conclusion can be obtained by further symbolic manipulation without the missing bounds.

## TOOL PROVENANCE AND EVIDENCE STRENGTH

Connected GitHub: pinned native project-source access; five reconstructed source files match their returned Git blobs and the frozen contract/source-lock hashes. Library: complete supplied Q043 journal and targeted inherited V26 qualification content. Web: primary-paper metadata/abstract for methodological context. Python/NumPy: reproducible synthetic checks, hashes and retained-source/map integrity. Tool outputs do not create absent physical reference data.

Evidence strength: STRONG for the recovered frozen contract and conditional analytic inequalities; INSUFFICIENT to answer the downstream cosmological question. Conclusion-critical limitations are the missing independent valid reference/error envelopes, domain/tail qualification, optimizer/sampling qualification and switched-source equivalence. Finite checks do not supply these. The original scientific hypotheses and unresolved tensions retain their previous status.

## PRESERVED Q043 HISTORICAL JOURNAL AND SOURCE/CLAIM REGISTERS

The following complete historical record is unchanged. Its date-specific state and next-task recommendations are superseded by the current Q044 entries above where explicitly updated. It remains provenance, not a second active journal.

ANBEFALET CHATGPT-SETUP

MODEL / MODE: Functional profile B/F — deep reasoning with bounded Work repository/file execution.
REASONING: High for scientific-status, source-lineage and accepted/candidate distinctions.
TOOLS: Connected GitHub reads, pinned Git checkouts, local Python/JSON/hash analysis, file retrieval and independent read-only review.
WHY: The task is evidence and execution-state integration with a large provenance chain. No new cosmological research or numerical campaign is required.
CURRENT SETUP IS SUFFICIENT. No model switch was performed; account-specific selectable modes and maximum context capacity were not independently verified.

BUBBLEVERSE — AFSLUTTET SAG

Q: Q043 — explicitly designated by the operator.
CASE-ID: NOT DOCUMENTED.
STATUS: CLOSED — LOCAL PREPARATION AND VALIDATION ONLY.
NEXT DESTINATION: MOTOR 14 — UNIVERSE REVISION / COMPARISON.
Date/time: 2026-10-09T08:14:45+02:00; timezone Europe/Copenhagen.
Task lineage: TASK-Q042-M14-SYNC-001.
Result: R-Q043-REPOSITORY-INTEGRATION-001.

## SAMLET JOURNAL

This is the active relevant journal for the bounded Q043 integration investigation. Q043 names this investigation; it does not rename Q042 sources, reopen Q042 or add new Q043 physics to the candidate. The original Q042 source register and both claim-map trees appear in full below without renumbering. The cumulative Q042 source journal remains byte-for-byte preserved inside the model preparation diff. A standalone authoritative Copy Box 1 was not supplied or independently located; a complete rewrite of Bubbleverse's global knowledge is therefore not claimed.

### J-043-01 — Question and scope

[TECHNICAL INTEGRATION] Can the Q042 inconclusive closure be incorporated into a consistent candidate model and execution-control state, preserving all source and qualification boundaries and passing the existing update gates?

Authorized work: preparation and local validation across the accepted-model and execution repositories. The question concerns state consistency and provenance, not discovery of a shared physical mechanism. Physics reruns, new optimizer starts and production restarts are outside this investigation.

### J-043-02 — Verified starting repositories

[VERIFIED REPOSITORY STATE] Both live default-branch heads match the incoming pins:

| Repository | Verified starting HEAD | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Morfindien/bubbleverse-model | 10fa83797b2f7740519d4e43b1bebf0a6e35bada | Accepted/candidate/formal model, release and provenance |
| Morfindien/Bubbleverse | 72cf9e92fc794c122f593a77b6a555e6e97f6a2e | Execution/evidence and permanent launcher |

The accepted model remains v0.3 / R000003 / Q001–Q041. Its active promoted Q041 candidate record, canonical model, canonical release and older accepted snapshots remain unchanged. Before application the live execution registry still says V29 ACTIVE. Local preparation is distinct from remote synchronization.

Technical provenance: I-Q043-REPOSITORY-INSPECTION-001, the incoming I-M14-REPOSITORY-001 pins and the verified GitHub V29 run.

### J-043-03 — Inherited scientific state

[INHERITED, UNCHANGED] Q035 harmonization removed the classifier-dependent stable/non-stable contrast. Q036–Q038 retain the internal continuous CamSpec–HiLLiPoP fitted-geometry difference, exact-common-TT survival and four-coordinate compact representation. These are not evidence of physical causality. Q039 retains the negative results for the frozen tested interventions; they do not eliminate all conceivable implementation changes.

Q040 remains a legitimate mathematical target with unqualified numerical endpoints; its science products remain excluded. Q041 V19 is a valid controlled computational non-result, with 0/32 documented complete chains and an executed scope narrower than the original contract. It establishes neither physical agreement nor physical disagreement.

C-036-IMPL / CTR-PLANCK-IMPL-001 remains an unresolved methodological geometry tension; downstream physical significance remains unknown. CTR-H0-001 / C-001 remains unresolved. CTR-HIST-BASIN-LABEL-001 remains resolved methodologically. No tension was silently resolved by this integration.

Sources: supplied handoff; relevant Q001–Q042 journal pages 120–132; inherited original source/claim maps below; accepted baseline layers.

### J-043-04 — Q042 closure and evidence limitations

[DOCUMENTED INCONCLUSIVE CLOSURE] Q042 is CLOSED. The tested documented strategies did not establish scientifically qualified execution of the exact original Q041 downstream-portability contract. General feasibility remains INCONCLUSIVE; universal impossibility is not established.

REFERENCE_TRUTH = BLOCKED. NUMERICAL_FINAL_RESULT = UNRESOLVED. PRODUCTION_RESTART_AUTHORIZED = false.

V29 is completed prerequisite-only. V30/V31 are completed bounded attempts with local partial outputs. V31 remains LOCAL_NOT_COMMITTED / Q042_COMPARISON_V31_LOCAL_001; it has no asserted GitHub numerical run or qualified remote checkpoint. No complete history or computed tau is established. Captured initialized inputs do not establish upstream physical accuracy.

All 80 optimizer records retain their original cumulative-journal/artifact provenance and validity limits. Finite-start objectives and flag 0 do not prove global minima. Q043 did not reconstruct or recalculate these records independently.

Sources: I-Q042-COMPARISON-V31-001; I-Q042-COMPARISON-V31-VALIDATION-001; I-Q042-V31-INGESTION-001; exact immutable cumulative source artifact.

### J-043-05 — Frozen contract and conditional cap result

[INHERITED CONDITIONAL MATHEMATICAL LIMITATION] The original science contract is preserved with SHA256 41e4d8f026933f64dbe41048f894002f479ba2b504432b33dc155f4dfe71378c. Its paired native Planck arms, two models, common external blocks and original decision rules are not altered.

Cap32 concerns the frozen V31 support-output policy, not a physical parameter. Conservative counts UPPER 138 and LOWER 3,002 are representation-specific candidates, not physical minima. The inherited necessary-condition result retains all four assumptions: an existing admissible absolutely continuous solution; frozen source/domain identity; continuation contained in the received global rails; and unchanged retained intervals/support policy.

The preserved certificate does not prove original switched-RHS existence/uniqueness, original executable rounding accuracy, upstream accuracy, a downstream acceptance budget or feasibility failure of every alternative method. More runtime alone is rejected as a sufficient repair for this unchanged policy. Retroactive cap expansion is not reproduction. The certificate mathematics and trajectories were not rerun here.

### J-043-06 — Physical parameters and model candidates

[UNCHANGED] There is no single accepted H0 value. Inherited benchmarks remain 73.50 ± 0.81, 67.24 ± 0.35 and 68.51 ± 0.58 km s^-1 Mpc^-1 with their separate local/CMB/DESI+BBN inference chains. They are not Q042 or Q043 outputs. n_scf remains 3.

MOD-EDE-N3 / MECH-EDE-N3-001 stays ACTIVE / CONSTRAINED; MECH-ME-001 stays ACTIVE / CONSTRAINED; MECH-DYNDE-001 stays ACTIVE. No complete Hubble-tension solution, model preference, new equation, parameter reduction or physical mechanism follows from this work.

The unchanged physical files are checked against the exact accepted base; H0 benchmarks/uncertainties, parameters, equations, assumptions, result registry and mechanism/contradiction states are preserved.

### J-043-07 — Prepared model integration

[LOCAL VALIDATED PREPARATION] The recovered prospective v0.4 / R000004 candidate remains under provenance/prepared_candidates/Q042/. It is CANDIDATE_PREPARED_NOT_PROMOTED with proposed evidence boundary Q042. Canonical accepted/candidate/model/release state stays through Q041.

The proposed projection incorporates Q042 closure, completed V29 prerequisite provenance, local partial V30/V31 lineage, reference/accuracy/history constraints, conditional cap-domain restrictions and history on PRED-EDE-PORTABILITY-001. That prediction remains OPEN. Original observations, mechanisms and contradiction states are retained; all 91 source objects and inherited/new claim maps match exactly.

The existing scientific/formal validators inspect a disposable Q042 projection. They are not weakened and their success is not candidate admission or promotion.

### J-043-08 — Prepared execution reconciliation

[LOCAL CONTROL UPDATE] V29 run 37362125253 is verified completed/success, attempt 1, at execution commit 72cf9e92fc794c122f593a77b6a555e6e97f6a2e. The prepared registry changes V29 from ACTIVE to COMPLETED, preserves its completion identity and denies launch eligibility. Its historical workflow, frozen contract, manifest and existing artifacts are not deleted.

The permanent launcher is unchanged. Actual execution of its resolver rejects completed V29, unknown IDs and unsafe IDs without producing dispatch output, while an unrelated ACTIVE target still resolves. The prepared registry has zero ACTIVE Q042 targets and preserves all 43 unrelated entries.

The README and treatment override supersede stale pending execution/ingestion instructions. The current override identifies integration case Q043 and source Q042 separately. The execution closure keeps local V30/V31 outputs as evidence with no new remote numerical target.

### J-043-09 — New defect found and repaired

[TECHNICAL DEFECT RESOLVED] The recovered closure record still pointed to candidate/updates/Q042/source_register.json after the previous package moved unadmitted candidate preparation to provenance/prepared_candidates/Q042/.

A direct cross-repository resolution check failed before correction. The reference now resolves to Morfindien/bubbleverse-model:provenance/prepared_candidates/Q042/source_register.json and matches the exact original 91-object source register. This repairs provenance navigation; it changes no scientific source object, claim or original V31 execution identity.

### J-043-10 — Fresh validation and review

[LOCALLY COMPUTED TECHNICAL CHECKS]

| Check | Actual result |
|---|---|

These checks establish internal preparation/control consistency. They are not independent cosmological observations or qualified numerical science.

### J-043-11 — Actual result and remaining deployment state

[SCOPED ANSWER] Yes: a bounded, internally consistent Q042 candidate and execution-control update can be prepared and pass the existing gates at the verified pinned bases. This is demonstrated by the delivered local diffs and fresh validation.

REMOTE_SYNC = NOT_PERFORMED. ACTIVE_CANDIDATE_ADMISSION = NOT_PERFORMED. CANDIDATE_PROMOTION = NOT_PERFORMED. No official accepted v0.4 release is asserted. Local preparation does not mean the live stale ACTIVE entry has already changed.

Q043 closes only the documented preparation/validation question. Later review/application and any controlled admission/promotion are separate operations. They require current-head checks and the established update procedure; no numerical workflow dispatch is necessary.

### J-043-12 — Preserved rejections and dependencies

[REJECTED] Unchanged V31 completion-by-time-alone as a sufficient repair; retrospective cap expansion as reproduction; tau/complete-history/global-minima inference from partial records; diagnostic reference as a qualified benchmark; Q040 invalid science endpoints; green workflow as physical truth; technical failure as model falsification; classifier labels as invariant physical modes.

[DEPENDENCIES] CamSpec and HiLLiPoP share Planck information. The PDFs, accepted compression and cumulative handoff reuse evidence. Repeated implementation checks do not become independent observations. The original bibliography's missing details remain missing. Source and tool provenance do not create absent scientific error budgets.

## DOKUMENTERET SVAR

PASS_LOCAL_PREPARATION_AND_VALIDATION_ONLY. The prepared candidate and execution controls pass the existing bounded gates. Actual remote synchronization and accepted-state integration have not occurred. Q042 remains closed inconclusively; reference truth stays blocked and numerical final result unresolved.

## INTEGRATIONSSTATUS

PARTIAL INTEGRATION — internally consistent evidence/control preparation. No new shared physical mechanism is established.

## INTEGREREDE RESULTATER

Q042 inconclusive closure; prerequisite-only V29 completion; local partial V30/V31 lineage; conditional cap limitations; preserved source/claim lineage; unresolved portability history; retirement of stale current execution instructions.

## FÆLLES STRUKTUR

A consistent source-to-result-to-proposed-model-to-control provenance chain. This is administrative/epistemic structure, not physical unification.

## NULLMODEL / SEPARAT FORKLARING

Operational M0: disconnected source/model/control status with V29 stale ACTIVE. Operational M1: one qualified closure state represented consistently in the prepared layers and launch controls. M1 resolves the demonstrated operational divergence locally. No statistical or physical M0/M1 model-comparison calculation is warranted or performed.

## MODELKERNE

The accepted physical core is unchanged. The integration requires explicit accepted/candidate boundaries, immutable source identities, qualified result status and exact completed-target gating.

## HVAD INTEGRATIONEN ERSTATTER

Stale active V29 and pending execution/ingestion guidance are superseded in the prepared package. No active physical model component is replaced. Raw historical source bytes remain preserved.

## NYE KONFLIKTER

No known new conclusion-critical scientific conflict. The remaining live-versus-prepared repository divergence is explicit; it is not silently resolved by local validation.

## INTEGRATIONSGÆLD

Operational: review/apply the exported diffs using fresh repository heads, then use the existing separately controlled candidate admission/promotion procedure if pursued. Scientific: the inherited missing reference/upstream/binary/downstream qualification remains unresolved; Q043 supplies no accuracy budget.

## NYE PREDIKTIONER

No new independent physical prediction. PRED-EDE-PORTABILITY-001 remains OPEN with Q042 history in the proposal.

## UAFHÆNGIG VALIDERING

INTERNALLY CONSISTENT, with an independent read-only technical review. No new independent physical validation.

## EVIDENSSTYRKE

STRONG for the bounded local integrity, preparation and launcher-control conclusion at the pinned bases. INSUFFICIENT to claim live synchronization, accepted promotion, a numerical final result or physical inference.

## KONKLUSIONSKRITISKE FORBEHOLD

Standalone Copy Box 1 is missing. The original 80 records, cap proof and original-binary accuracy were not independently recomputed. Six structured/cumulative source hashes are verified; inherited journal/Main Book PDF hashes were not rehashed here. No remote write, admission, promotion, numerical dispatch or new optimizer start occurred. Source Q042 remains unchanged even though the operator designated the integration investigation Q043.

## KILDER OG PROVENANCE

Primary project anchors:

- [Accepted model at pinned commit](https://github.com/Morfindien/bubbleverse-model/tree/10fa83797b2f7740519d4e43b1bebf0a6e35bada).
- [Execution repository at pinned commit](https://github.com/Morfindien/Bubbleverse/tree/72cf9e92fc794c122f593a77b6a555e6e97f6a2e).
- [Verified prerequisite-only V29 run](https://github.com/Morfindien/Bubbleverse/actions/runs/37362125253).
- I-Q042-V31-INGESTION-001 and original decision/audit/certificate/checks/cumulative-handoff bytes.
- The recovered q042_model_candidate.patch and q042_execution_sync.patch; their earlier q042_sync_result(1).json is historical preparation evidence, not proof of current remote synchronization.
- Relevant Q001–Q042 updated journal pages retrieved from the supplied current file; original accepted Q041 input lineage remains retained.
- I-Q043-REPOSITORY-INSPECTION-001 and I-Q043-PREPARATION-VALIDATION-001: new technical records only, kept separately from the original 91-source register.

Verified immutable source digests and delivery diff digests are serialized in q043_integration_result.json. Repeated source objects/derived checks carry no new evidential independence.

## TIL MOTOR 14

Register Q043 as a bounded technical preparation/validation result, without converting it to a physical result or pretending the live repositories are synchronized. Preserve Q042's inconclusive closure, Q041 unresolved physical portability, Q040 endpoint exclusion and existing H0/geometry tensions. The next concrete action, if pursued, is controlled review/application of the delivered repository diffs, followed by separately gated candidate admission/promotion. Do not return to an unchanged Q042 numerical campaign.

## DELIVERY — same result, reviewable artifacts

| Artifact | Purpose |
|---|---|
| q043_model_preparation.patch | Full model preparation diff, including exact cumulative source history and original 91-source/maps |
| q043_execution_sync.patch | Execution README/registry/control preparation, including corrected cross-repository source reference |
| q042_closure_state.json | Corrected individual machine-readable execution closure record |
| q043_integration_result.json | Machine-readable serialization of this Q043 result, validation, limitations and original source/maps |

No ZIP is required. Neither diff performs numerical dispatch or promotes the accepted model.

Appendix E — Bubbleverse Q-Journals —
Q001-Q043
Introduction to the Journal Record
The main chapters of this book organize the surviving science logically. This appendix
preserves the investigation chronologically.
Each Q-Journal records, where available, the question that was asked, the scientific state
entering the question, inherited results, hypotheses, methods, evidence, programmes,
workflows, tests, intermediate and final results, failed attempts, negative results, model
changes, provenance and the handoff to the next question.
Many early journals are retrospective reconstructions because complete journal records
were not originally maintained at the time of those questions. Their retrospective status
remains explicitly labelled. Missing historical GitHub information is not filled by invention.
Later corrections do not erase earlier journal states. Superseded numbers, failed numerical
routes and earlier interpretations remain historical records where they are required to
reconstruct the path of the investigation.
The supplied journal package contains two versions of Q009 describing the same Q, date,
question and scientific result. The more structured later copy is retained here as the
published Q009 record; the earlier editorial duplicate is not reproduced a second time.
No standalone Q010 journal was present in the supplied journal package. Its absence is
recorded explicitly at its chronological position rather than reconstructed from later
knowledge.

Q001
BUBBLEVERSE — Q-JOURNAL
Q-ID: Q001 Status: CONFIRMED JOURNAL TYPE: RETROSPECTIVE RECONSTRUCTION RECONSTRUCTED ON: 2026-09-08
Question:
What observational facts about the universe are robustly established, distinct from model-
dependent interpretation?
STARTING STATE
No prior Bubbleverse model. Q001 establishes the empirical baseline.
Core rule: observation ≠ measurement ≠ reconstruction ≠ inference ≠ interpretation.
HYPOTHESES
Supported:
The observable universe is structured, evolving, expanding, and was hotter/denser in
the past.
Rejected:
ΛCDM is directly observed.
A specific dark-matter particle is established.
Dark energy is directly detected.
A hot early universe proves a (t=0) singularity.
METHOD & EVIDENCE
Primary-source review and epistemic classification.
Main evidence:
CMB: Fixsen, Planck, ACT
Expansion/BAO: DESI
Supernovae/H₀: Riess, Perlmutter, Pantheon+, SH0ES
Lensing/dark matter: Planck lensing, Bullet Cluster
Early universe: primordial deuterium
Gravitational waves: GW150914, GW170817
No numerical Bubbleverse program or workflow was required.
KEY RESULT
Robust observations establish a dynamic, expanding universe with a hotter, denser past.
Dark-matter microphysics, dark-energy nature, and several cosmological parameters
remain model-dependent or unresolved.
Contradiction retained: Hubble-tension inference chains disagree.

NEGATIVE RESULTS / MIKAMI
Killed claims:
“ΛCDM is observed.”
“Dark matter particle detected.”
“Dark energy substance detected.”
“Hot Big Bang proves singularity.”
MODEL CHANGE
Before: No Bubbleverse baseline.
After: Observation-first cosmological framework established.
Change: Foundational model created.
GITHUB / PROVENANCE
Repository / commits / workflows: NOT RECORDED AT TIME OF Q
Programs: None.
Provenance reconstructed from Q001 outputs, manuscript material, handoff context, and
cited primary literature.
REPRODUCIBILITY
Recheck the listed primary sources, classify every claim by epistemic level, verify key
numerical values, preserve dataset dependencies, and apply the same acceptance criteria.
CONCLUSION
Q001 establishes Bubbleverse’s empirical foundation and permanent rule:
Never silently promote interpretation into observation.
NEXT-Q HANDOFF
Next Q: Q002
Reason:
Cosmic expansion now requires separate analysis of what is directly observed versus
model-inferred.
Next question:
What observations establish cosmic expansion, and which parts of the inferred expansion
history depend on cosmological modelling?
FINAL ANSWER: Empirical baseline established.
MIKAMI: Four overstrong claims rejected.
MODEL CHANGE: Observation-first framework created.
GITHUB: Historical provenance not recorded.
NEXT: Q002 — cosmic expansion.

Q-ID: Q002
Date/time: 2026-08-26 20:31 CEST
Status: CONFIRMED
JOURNAL TYPE: RETROSPECTIVE RECONSTRUCTION
RECONSTRUCTED ON: 2026-09-08
Question:
What do observations show about cosmic expansion, and which conclusions depend on
cosmological models?
2. STARTING STATE
Model entering Q: Q001 observational baseline.
Inherited:
Observation must be separated from calibration, reconstruction and interpretation.
Constraint:
Do not equate redshift, (H(z)), (H 0), scale factor or acceleration.
3. HYPOTHESES
Tested:
H1: Multiple probes support expansion.
H2: Redshift alone proves expansion.
H3: Simple tired-light/static models remain viable.
Rejected:
H2 — redshift alone is insufficient.
H3 — simple no-time-dilation models conflict with SN time dilation.
Surviving:
H1 — CONFIRMED.
4. METHOD & EVIDENCE
Methods:
Literature comparison, cross-probe consistency and observation/inference audit.
Evidence:
Hubble 1929; Riess/Perlmutter; Pantheon+; Goldhaber/Blondin SN time dilation;
BAO/eBOSS/DESI; Moresco chronometers; GW170817 standard siren; CMB (T(z)).
Programs/workflows:
None verified or required.

BUBBLEVERSE Q JOURNALS

Tests:
Redshift-distance consistency, SN time dilation, BAO, chronometers, standard sirens, simple
tired-light falsification.
5. KEY RESULTS
1+z= a(t0)
, H= ˙a
a(tem)
a
Redshift is observed; (a(t)), (H(z)), (H 0) and acceleration are inferred.
Final result:
Cosmic expansion is CONFIRMED by multiple consistent probes. Late acceleration is
strongly supported but does not prove ( Λ ) or dark energy.
Limitations:
Calibration, (rd), stellar modelling, peculiar velocities and geometric assumptions.
Contradiction:
“We directly observe space expanding” is too strong.
6. NEGATIVE RESULTS / MIKAMI
Killed:
- Redshift alone proves expansion.
- (H(z)) is directly observed.
- BAO gives absolute (H(z)) without (rd).
- Acceleration proves ( Λ ).
- Simple no-time-dilation tired light.
No computational failures recorded.
7. MODEL CHANGE
Before: Expansion evidence present.
After: Expansion = CONFIRMED; acceleration = strongly supported; mechanism = OPEN.
Change: Epistemic model strengthened.
8. GITHUB / PROVENANCE
Repository/commits/workflows/programs/artifacts:
NOT RECORDED AT TIME OF Q.
Provenance:
Reconstructed from surviving Q material, manuscript state and primary literature. No
identifiers invented.

9. REPRODUCIBILITY
Re-check the cited probes, separate observations from inferred quantities, and test whether
the complete evidence set is consistent with expansion and incompatible with simple no-
time-dilation alternatives.
10. CONCLUSION
The observable Universe is very strongly consistent with an expanding large-scale
geometry. The exact expansion history and cause of acceleration remain more model-
dependent.
11. NEXT-Q HANDOFF
Next Q: Q003
Reason:
Determine exactly what (H 0) is and how different observational chains infer it.
FINAL ANSWER: Expansion CONFIRMED.
Q-JOURNAL: This journal.
MIKAMI: Redshift-only, direct-(H(z)), assumption-free BAO, acceleration=( Λ ), simple tired
light rejected.
MODEL CHANGE: Expansion promoted to CONFIRMED.

1. IDENTITY
Q-ID: Q003
Date/time: 2026-08-26 23:55 CEST
Status: CONFIRMED / SUPPORTED
Question: What is (H 0), how is it inferred, and where do calibration and model dependence
enter?
2. STARTING STATE
Model entering Q: Early Bubbleverse Hubble-tension framework.
Inherited:
- Q001: observation ≠ inference.
- Q002: expansion is robust; redshift ≠ (H 0).
3. HYPOTHESES
Rejected:
- (H 0) is directly observed.
- CMB/local/BAO estimates are equivalent or fully independent.
Surviving:
Different methods provide partially independent inference routes.
4. METHOD & EVIDENCE
Method: Map each route from observable calibration/model → →(H 0).
Sources: K-002, K-014, K-019, K-024–K-030.
Programs/workflows: NOT RECORDED AT TIME OF Q.
5. KEY RESULTS

Key benchmarks:
- H0DN: (73.50±0.81)
- CMB-SPA, flat ΛCDM: (67.24±0.35)
- DESI DR2+BBN, flat ΛCDM: (68.51±0.58)
H0DN vs CMB-SPA: ~(7.1σ ).
H0DN vs DESI+BBN: ~(5σ ).

BUBBLEVERSE Q JOURNALS

Final result: (H 0) is an inferred parameter, not a raw observable. The tension is between
different inference chains.
Limitations: No joint likelihood/covariance reconstruction.
6. NEGATIVE RESULTS / MIKAMI
Killed:
- “(H 0) is directly measured.”
- “BAO gives model-free absolute (H 0).”
- “7.1σ tension = 7.1σ evidence for new physics.”
7. MODEL CHANGE
Before: Planck vs SH0ES shorthand.
After: Multi-chain structure using H0DN, CMB-SPA, DESI+BBN and alternative probes.
Change: MODIFIED / STRENGTHENED.
8. GITHUB / PROVENANCE
Repository/commits/workflows/results: NOT RECORDED AT TIME OF Q.
Provenance: Reconstructed from Q003 result, source register and handoff material.
9. REPRODUCIBILITY
Verify listed sources, reconstruct each inference chain, map shared dependencies, and
compare benchmarks without double counting.
10. CONCLUSION
Q003 established that the Hubble tension is a conflict among distinct inference chains for
the same parameter. Its cause remained unresolved; no new physics was established.
11. NEXT-Q HANDOFF
Next Q: Q004
Question: Is the (H 0) tension robust after known systematics, calibration dependencies,
model assumptions and independent probes are treated together?

Q-ID: Q004
Original date/time: NOT RECORDED
Status: SUPPORTED
Question:
Is the difference between the main H₀ inferences robust when known systematics,
calibration dependencies, model assumptions, and independent methods are considered
together?
2. STARTING STATE
Model entering Q: Bubbleverse H₀ evidence structure after CASE-003.
Inherited:
- H0DN: 73.50 ± 0.81 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹.
- CMB-SPA, flat ΛCDM: 67.24 ± 0.35.
- DESI DR2 + BBN: 68.51 ± 0.58.
Constraint: H₀ is an inferred parameter, not a raw observable; overlapping evidence must
not be double-counted.
3. HYPOTHESES
Tested:
H1: Main H₀ tension survives known systematics.
H2: One dominant local systematic explains it.
H3: One CMB/Planck-specific systematic explains it.
Rejected as sufficient single causes: HST Cepheid crowding alone; Planck pipeline alone;
SN-Ia rung alone.
Surviving: residual local/systematic combinations, peculiar velocities/selection, stellar
calibration, early-/late-Universe model dependence, sound-horizon physics, multi-effect
explanations.
4. METHOD & EVIDENCE
Compared covariance/dependence structure and cross-checks across local distance, CMB,
BAO+BBN, TRGB/JAGB, megamasers, strong lenses, and standard sirens.
Primary sources: K-024–K-032; supporting K-002, K-014, K-019.
Programs/workflows: NOT RECORDED AT TIME OF Q.

Numerical tests: simple Gaussian tension calculations and cross-method consistency
assessment.
5. KEY RESULTS
- H0DN vs CMB-SPA: ΔH₀ = 6.26 ± 0.88, 7.1σ. ≈
- H0DN vs DESI DR2 + BBN: 5.0σ. ≈
- CCHP JWST-only TRGB/JAGB differences from H0DN are only 2σ before shared ≈
covariance and are not independent.
- Independent megamaser/lensing/GW routes remain too imprecise to adjudicate alone.
Final result:
The H₀ discrepancy is a robust Type-C parameter tension, Level 3, but its cause is not
established.
Limitations: no ~1% fully independent third H₀ route; residual local calibration structure
remains.
Contradictions: C-001 persists; C-002 reduced to internal late-Universe methodological
tension.
6. NEGATIVE RESULTS / MIKAMI
Killed as full explanations:
- HST Cepheid crowding alone.
- Planck-specific pipeline alone.
- SN-Ia final rung alone.
Reason: independent/cross-pipeline evidence retains substantial high-versus-low H₀
disagreement.
7. MODEL CHANGE
Before: H₀ discrepancy active but robustness not yet fully established.
After: C-001 = ROBUST ANOMALY / TYPE C / LEVEL 3. C-002 = internal methodological
tension.
Change: promoted C-001; constrained C-002 and several explanations.
Reason: multi-method robustness and systematic cross-checks.
8. GITHUB / PROVENANCE
Repository: UNKNOWN / NOT RECORDED
Commits/workflows/programs/artifacts: NOT RECORDED AT TIME OF Q.

To reproduce: recover cited primary sources; reconstruct H ₀ benchmark comparisons;
preserve stated model assumptions and evidence overlaps; reproduce Gaussian tension
estimates; apply the same independence/systematics criteria.
Missing historical software/Git metadata: NOT RECORDED AT TIME OF Q.
10. CONCLUSION
The Hubble tension survives serious treatment of the major known calibration, covariance,
model, and cross-method issues. It is strong enough to require explanation, but not to
establish new physics.
11. NEXT-Q HANDOFF
Why: the anomaly is established; the remaining problem is discrimination among
explanations.
Next Q: Q005
Next question:
Which remaining systematic and cosmological explanation classes can quantitatively
reduce the robust H₀ tension while remaining consistent with H0DN, CMB-SPA, DESI DR2 +
BBN, internal late-Universe calibration structure, and physically independent H ₀ routes?
REQUIRED END-OF-Q OUTPUT
1. FINAL ANSWER: Robust H₀ parameter tension confirmed at Level 3; cause unresolved.
2. Q-JOURNAL: This retrospective reconstruction.
3. MIKAMI GRAVEYARD UPDATE: crowding-only, Planck-only, and SN-rung-only
explanations killed as sufficient full causes.
4. MODEL CHANGE SUMMARY: C-001 promoted; C-002 constrained.
5. REPRODUCIBILITY / GITHUB REFERENCES: sources preserved; GitHub metadata not
recorded.
6. NEXT-Q HANDOFF: Q005 — discriminate surviving explanation classes.

2. STARTING STATE
Model entering Q: Robust H0-anomali, Type C / Level 3; årsag ukendt.
Inherited: H0DN 73.50±0.81; CMB-SPA 67.24±0.35 (~7.1σ); DESI DR2+BBN 68.51±0.58.
Constraints: H0 71.5 cosmology-screen; systematik, calibration og alternative H0-ruter ≥
skal respekteres; common-backend ≠ paper-native reproduction.
3. HYPOTHESES
Tested:
H1: Late-Universe systematik kan forklare spændingen.
H2: EDE/recombination physics kan hæve H0.
H3: Andre udvidelser (N e f f ,l at e−D E , I D E , P M F ,a xiod il at on) kan give fuld løsning.
Rejected: Ordinary peculiar velocities/standard cosmic variance som fuld løsning. Generic

electron mass forsøger at flytte H0 fra cirka 68–70 til området H0 71.5? ≥
2. STARTING STATE
Model entering Q: Frozen Q005 common backend; n=3 EDE and varying-mₑ
active/constrained candidates.
Inherited results:
Q005: ΛCDM H0=68.494422, χ²=547.482504.
Q005: n=3 EDE H0=70.853292; varying-mₑ H0=70.157184, χ²=544.887898.
Constraints: Fixed backend/data/priors/bounds/nuisance; H0 profiles at baseline, 71.5, 72.5,
73.5; components Planck low-ℓ, ACT DR6, DESI DR2, BBN.
3. HYPOTHESES
Tested:
H1: Same likelihood component dominates both mechanisms.
H2: n=3 EDE is primarily CMB/ACT limited.
H3: varying-mₑ transfers penalty toward DESI/BBN.
Rejected: H1 — component attribution differs by mechanism.
Surviving: H2 supported; H3 supported.
4. METHOD & EVIDENCE
Methods: Fixed-H0 profile optimization with non-overlapping χ² decomposition and
parameter tracking.

Final result: High-H0 barriers are mechanism-specific: EDE is primarily ACT-limited;
varying-mₑ is primarily DESI/BBN-limited.
Limitations: Common-backend, not exact K-036/K-038 reproduction; global minima not
proven. EDE Δχ² profile is non-monotonic and remains a preserved numerical irregularity.
6. NEGATIVE RESULTS / MIKAMI
Failed attempts: RUN #1 and #2 failed before optimization because rendered YAML
filenames became ...pyaml; technical failures, not physics failures.
Mikami Graveyard:
Killed route: “one universal high-H0 likelihood barrier.”
Reason: EDE and varying-mₑ show different dominant penalties.
7. MODEL CHANGE
Before: Surviving high-H0 candidates treated broadly as facing a generic cosmological
barrier.
After: Model-specific constraint topology.
Change: MODIFIED / CONSTRAINED.
Reason: Q006 likelihood decomposition.

10. CONCLUSION
Q006 established that reducing the sound horizon does not encounter one universal
observational barrier. n=3 EDE primarily accumulates ACT DR6 penalty, whereas varying-
mₑ shifts the dominant cost toward DESI DR2 and BBN. Neither mechanism is globally
falsified.
11. NEXT-Q HANDOFF
Why another Q is required: Q006 located the penalties but did not identify which physical
ACT observables/degeneracies create the EDE barrier.
Next Q: Q007
Next question:
Hvilke konkrete fysiske observables og parameterdegeneracies i ACT DR6 gør n=3 EDE dyr
ved H0 71.5, og hvorfor kan varying electron mass undgå den samme ACT-straf, mens ≥
dens fit cost i stedet flyttes mod DESI DR2 og BBN?

Q-ID: Q007
Date/time: 2026-08-30 11:42 CEST
Status: SUPPORTED
Question: Which concrete physical observables and parameter degeneracies in ACT DR6
make n=3 EDE costly at H 0≥71.5, and why can varying electron mass avoid the same ACT
penalty while shifting fit cost toward DESI DR2 and BBN?
2. STARTING STATE
Model entering Q: Frozen Q005/Q006 common backend; n=3 EDE + varying-me; global
minima not established.
Inherited: Q006 found ACT dominant for high-H 0 EDE; varying-me cost shifted mainly to
DESI/BBN. Q006 EDE profile was non-monotonic.
Constraints: No reoptimization; preserve exact Q006 points/covariance; no independent
TT/TE/EE claim; negative signed contributions allowed.
3. HYPOTHESES
Tested:
H1: One ACT spectrum/region dominates EDE penalty.
H2: Penalty is distributed across correlated spectral structure.
H3: varying-me avoids EDE-like ACT penalty through different recombination degeneracy.
Rejected: Single isolated ACT observable as complete explanation.
Surviving: H2 + H3 — supported; TE/intermediate-ℓ concentration within distributed
covariance-coupled penalty.
4. METHOD & EVIDENCE
Methods: Exact covariance attribution ci=di (C
−1d )i; grouped TT/TE/EE and descriptive
multipole bands; EDE vs varying-me control.

5. KEY RESULTS
EDE Δχ²_ACT: 71.5: +2.135; 72.5: +9.348; 73.5: +8.966.
TE attribution: +1.667, +5.914, +6.765 respectively — largest positive spectrum contribution
at all three points.
Varying-me Δχ²_ACT: 71.5: +1.042; 72.5: 0.227; 73.5: +0.100. −
Final result: High-H 0 EDE pays a distributed ACT spectral penalty concentrated in
TE/intermediate-ℓ; varying-me largely avoids this ACT cost and transfers constraint
pressure toward DESI/BBN.
Limitations: No global-minimum proof; ACT_LOW/MID/HIGH are descriptive; Q006 non-
monotonic EDE profile remains unresolved.
Contradiction: None fundamental; numerical profile irregularity preserved.
6. NEGATIVE RESULTS / MIKAMI
Failed attempts: Early V1 runs failed because fixed H 0 was incorrectly required from
serialized ”bestfit”; later ACT-data download timeout. Both technical, not physical failures.
Mikami Graveyard additions:
- “EE alone dominates the ACT EDE penalty” — rejected.
- “Sound-horizon reduction alone is sufficient” — rejected.
- “All early-Universe solutions face the same barrier” — rejected as too crude.
7. MODEL CHANGE
Before: Generic early-Universe/CMB barrier.
After: Model-specific constraint-transfer topology.
Change: MODIFIED / PROMOTED.
Reason: EDE and varying-me reach similar high H 0/rd r a g through sharply different
likelihood-penalty structures.

10. CONCLUSION
Q007 supports a model-specific constraint-transfer picture: n=3 EDE distorts CMB spectral
structure enough to incur a strong ACT penalty, especially through TE, whereas varying-me
preserves ACT compatibility more effectively but shifts the cost toward DESI/BBN. This
does not establish either model as a complete Hubble-tension solution.
11. NEXT-Q HANDOFF
Why: The EDE fixed-H 0 profile remains strongly non-monotonic and globality is
undocumented.
Next Q: Q008
Question: Is the Q006 non-monotonic n=3 EDE profile an optimizer/basin/global-
minimization artefact, or a reproducible property of the frozen likelihood?
REQUIRED END-OF-Q OUTPUT
FINAL ANSWER: EDE has a distributed ACT spectral penalty dominated positively by TE;
varying-me largely avoids it and transfers cost toward DESI/BBN.

2. STARTING STATE
Model entering Q: Q005 V14 frozen common backend; (n=3) EDE active/constrained, not
established new physics.
Inherited: Q006 profile ( Δ χ

Limitations: Global minima not established; basin replication unresolved at 70.85, 72.5 and

Contradiction: Q006’s apparent sharp non-monotonic barrier was not numerically robust.
6. NEGATIVE RESULTS / MIKAMI

10. CONCLUSION
Q008 established that the original Q006 (n=3) EDE non-monotonic profile—especially the
(+19.88) penalty at (H 0=72.5)—was not robust. Optimizer basin structure/incomplete
minimization materially produced the apparent barrier. The corrected values are best
observed, not documented global minima.
11. NEXT-Q HANDOFF
Why: Q007’s ACT TT/TE/EE attribution was evaluated at superseded Q006 basins.
Next Q: Q009
Question: At the corrected best-observed (n=3) EDE fixed-(H 0) minima, which ACT DR6
TT/TE/EE and multipole regions dominate the residual likelihood cost, and does Q007’s

FINAL ANSWER: Original Q006 non-monotonic profile was materially optimizer/basin-
driven; no global-minimum claim.

Final result: The old ACT barrier is not replaced by one universal non-ACT barrier; high-H0
constraint geometry is distributed, basin-dependent, and tied to multidimensional
parameter trade-offs.
Limitations: Q008 points are best-observed, not proven global minima; external viability

10. CONCLUSION
No single likelihood inherits the high-H0 penalty after the historical ACT barrier
disappears. Planck dominates the positive non-ACT cost at 71.5, non-ACT improves the fit at
72.5, and BBN is the largest positive non-ACT term at 73.5, while DESI improves at all three
points. The relevant structure is therefore a basin-dependent multidimensional constraint
geometry.
11. NEXT-Q HANDOFF
Why another Q is required: The scientific importance of Q008–Q010 depends on whether
the corrected basins are robust/global representatives of the frozen likelihood.
Next Q: Q011

2. STARTING STATE
Model: MOD-EDE-N3 / frozen Q005 V14 / ACTIVE–CONSTRAINED.
Inherited: Q011: (H 0=71.5, χ
2=546.364260), BEST-OBSERVED ONLY. Q009/Q010 contained

3. HYPOTHESES
H1: Previous attribution survives qualitatively.
H2: New basin materially changes attribution.
H3: A broad likelihood sign reverses.
Rejected: H3 — no broad sign reversal.
Surviving: H1 + H2 — qualitative structure survives, quantitative attribution changes.

10. CONCLUSION
The improved (H 0=71.5) EDE basin is primarily favored by ACT DR6, while Planck low-(ℓ)
and BBN oppose it and DESI DR2 mildly favors it. Q012 resolves the internal attribution
question but does not establish globality or physical EDE viability.
11. NEXT-Q HANDOFF
Next Q: Q013
Question: When model definitions, parameterizations, priors, dataset overlap and evidence
independence are treated explicitly, is the active Q011/Q012 (n=3) EDE region at fixed
(H 0=71.5) compatible with relevant external EDE constraints and independent
observational chains, or is it already excluded or substantially weakened?
Reason: Internal attribution is closed; external viability is now the main bottleneck.
REQUIRED END-OF-Q OUTPUT
FINAL ANSWER: Q009/Q010 qualitative attribution survives; active numerical 71.5
attribution is superseded by Q012 and is more strongly ACT-driven.

- K-036 uses (n=3) and permits roughly (f E D E=0.09±0.03, H 0=71.0±1.1), but shares
ACT/DESI/Planck data.
- K-038’s (f E D E<0.014) is (n=2) and cannot directly exclude Q011.
- K-039 is same-model (n=3); profile limits approximately (f E D E<0.094 , H 0<70.2) at ( σ 2σ ),
materially pressuring Q011.
- K-040 SPT-only allows (f E D E<0.12) but does not independently prefer (H 0≈71.5).
Final result: Q011’s (n=3) high-(H 0) region is not universally excluded, but materially
externally weakened and not independently certified.
Limitations: No direct common-likelihood ( Δ χ
2) evaluation of the exact Q011 region; K-039
limits are separate 1D profiles.
Contradiction: Previous K-036/K-038 same-model conflict dissolved.
6. NEGATIVE RESULTS / MIKAMI
Killed: “K-038 directly excludes Q011 (n=3).” — wrong model mapping.
Killed: “K-036 independently confirms Q011.” — substantial dataset overlap.
Killed: “External evidence has already ruled out all high-(H 0) (n=3) EDE.” — too strong.
7. MODEL CHANGE
Before: MOD-EDE-N3 — ACTIVE BUT CONDITIONAL.

using the same acceptance rule: same-model evidence may constrain Q011, overlapping
evidence is not independent replication.
10. CONCLUSION
The active (n=3) EDE basin survives as a candidate, but its physical interpretation is
substantially weaker than its internal ACT-driven fit alone suggests. Planck NPIPE provides
genuine same-model pressure, while SPT-only does not independently reproduce the high-
(H 0) preference.

Final result: High-H₀ n=3 EDE viability is strongly dataset/likelihood dependent; the exact
ACT/Q011 vector is not externally portable.
Limits: Planck/SPT are common-backend, not exact paper-native K-039/K-040

Final result: Planck/SPT difference is not one universal EDE CMB penalty; it arises from
different chain components and covariance-coupled spectral responses.
Limitations: Attribution ≠ causation; branches are common-backend approximations, not
exact K-039/K-040 reproductions.
Contradictions: None fundamental.

Q-ID: Q016
Date/time: 2026-09-04 06:25 CEST
Status: SUPPORTED
Question: While Planck NPIPE, SPT-3G D1 and ACT DR6 are examined on a deliberately
matched n=3 EDE surface with comparable CMB observables and overlapping multipole
ranges, can the documented difference in high-H₀ response be explained by
experiment-/likelihood-specific frequency, foreground, calibration, sky or covariance
structure, or does a common residual pattern survive across the experiments?
2. STARTING STATE
Model entering Q: MOD-EDE-N3 — ACTIVE / CONSTRAINED; ”mwt5345/class_ede”, commit
”5a131c91d657dd9a7c6364cc45b038710f8d0d97”.
Inherited: Q014 showed strong Planck vs weak SPT high-H₀ response; Q015 found different
covariance-aware Planck/SPT attribution patterns; exact Q011 vector already rejected as
universal endpoint.
Constraints: TT+TE+EE, ℓ=600–2000; fixed H₀=71.5 vs free profile; no cross-chain χ² sum;
chain-native nuisance reprofiling.
3. HYPOTHESES
Tested:
H1: response difference is experiment-/likelihood-specific.
H2: one common residual pattern survives across Planck/SPT/ACT.
H3: apparent Planck difference is optimizer/globality artefact.
Rejected: H2 — 0/9 matched residual cells shared the same non-zero sign. H3 — Planck low-
H₀ basin reproduced by multistart certification.
Surviving: H1 — supported; exact instrumental sub-cause remains unresolved.
4. METHOD & EVIDENCE
Methods: matched free/fixed profiling; covariance-aware residual decomposition by
TT/TE/EE and multipole band; multistart/globality checks.
Sources: K-036, K-039–K-046; Planck NPIPE/CamSpec, SPT-3G D1, ACT DR6.

5. KEY RESULTS
Planck matched primary penalty: Δχ²=+4.67204, mainly ℓ=600–999 (+3.22423).
SPT: +0.01465; ACT: +0.01512, both with strong internal cancellations.
Common residual sign: 0/9 cells.
Final result: Q016-A — EXPERIMENT-SPECIFIC LOCALIZATION.
Limitations: No unique frequency/calibration/foreground/covariance cause identified; no
combined inter-experiment significance; SPT/ACT full-MF secondary diagnostics technically
incomplete.
Contradictions: No fundamental cosmological contradiction identified.
6. NEGATIVE RESULTS / MIKAMI
Failed attempts: V1 dependency/bootstrap failure; V2 path/API failure; V3 Planck/ACT API
mismatches; SPT full-MF shape mismatch; ACT full-MF missing ”mflike”. Technical failures
only.
Mikami Graveyard additions:
- Common Planck/SPT/ACT residual-direction hypothesis — killed by 0/9 sign concordance.
- Planck optimizer-artifact explanation — killed by V16 multistart reproduction.
- Uniform CMB high-H₀ penalty — rejected.
7. MODEL CHANGE
Before: MOD-EDE-N3 active with unresolved optimizer/dataset-response ambiguity.
After: MOD-EDE-N3 remains active but explicitly strongly dataset-/likelihood-dependent.
Change: constrained / refined.
Reason: certified Planck–SPT–ACT response split without common residual direction.

10. CONCLUSION
Q016 establishes that the tested high-H₀ n=3 EDE response is not one common CMB
residual expressed with different strength. Planck shows a substantial penalty, while SPT
and ACT remain nearly indifferent through different cancellation structures. The result
localizes the discrepancy to experiment-/likelihood-response structure, not to a proven
instrumental systematic or new physics.
11. NEXT-Q HANDOFF

Why: Planck is now the principal unresolved mechanism bottleneck.
Next question: Is Planck’s H₀=71.5 penalty, especially at ℓ=600–999, localized to specific full-

distributed?

Q-ID: Q017 | Date: 2026-09-04 | Status: INCONCLUSIVE
QUESTION: On the certified Q016 n=3 EDE Planck NPIPE/CamSpec surface, is the high-H₀
penalty at H₀=71.5—especially the ℓ=600–999 contribution—localized to specific Planck TT
frequency, calibration, foreground or covariance directions in a full multifrequency
likelihood, or does the penalty remain broadly distributed after nuisance-aware
reprofiling?
STARTING STATE
Model: MOD-EDE-N3; n_scf=3; mwt5345/class_ede commit
5a131c91d657dd9a7c6364cc45b038710f8d0d97.
Inherited: Q016 certified Planck endpoints: FREE H₀=67.988328967159; FIXED H ₀=71.5.
Q016 localized most matched Planck penalty to ℓ=600–999; Q015 showed strong
covariance-coupled 143×217 structure.
Constraint: freeze cosmology/endpoints; full-MF Planck nuisance-only reprofiling; no
causal-systematic claim.
HYPOTHESES
H1: penalty localizes to one specific Planck direction.
H2: penalty remains broadly distributed.
H3: neither classification meets preregistered thresholds.
Rejected: H1, H2 under Q017 thresholds.
Surviving: H3 — INDETERMINATE / multidirectional response.
METHOD & EVIDENCE

Final: penalty survives nuisance reprofiling, but neither specific-localized nor broadly-
distributed criteria pass. Classification: INDETERMINATE.
Limit: attribution ≠ causal systematic; Q016 and Q017 objectives are different likelihood
constructions.
NEGATIVE RESULTS / MIKAMI

Mikami: killed strong claims “143×217 is the cause”, “calibration is the cause”, and “penalty
is demonstrably broadly distributed”.
MODEL CHANGE
Before: FC-CMB-002 allowed possible specific Planck
frequency/calibration/foreground/covariance localization.
After: FC-CMB-002 remains active only as a multidirectional Planck-specific

CONCLUSION
The Planck high-H₀ penalty is robust to the tested full-MF nuisance reprofiling, but its
ℓ=600–999 structure is neither sufficiently concentrated in one
frequency/nuisance/covariance direction nor sufficiently broad to satisfy the opposite
criterion. Q017 therefore closes as INDETERMINATE, not technically unresolved.

Question: When the same certified Q016 n=3 EDE Planck FREE and H 0=71.5 FIXED
endpoints are evaluated through a controlled bridge between Q016 CamSpec-lite and Q017
full-multifrequency CamSpec, what explains the penalty increase from +5.823856774789 to +17.397934872301, and is it one

Q018 confirms that Q016 and Q017 are valid but distinct likelihood objectives. Their
penalty difference must not be interpreted physically as an additive χ² term. Native
prior/objective semantics is subdominant; the dominant change belongs to the coupled full-
multifrequency Planck likelihood architecture.

Inherited: Q018: coupled likelihood-architecture dependence; Q019: likelihood choice shifts

Constraint: No cross-chain χ² summation; Shapley/interactions diagnostic only, not

Surviving: Limited multidimensional direction dominated by the primordial block;
physical/systematic cause remains unresolved.
4. METHOD & EVIDENCE
Method: 16 hybrid cosmological vertices × 2 likelihood architectures × 2 nuisance restarts =

Final result: LIMITED MULTIDIMENSIONAL DIRECTION LOCALIZED.
Limitation: Block-level only; does not establish ns alone, an instrumental systematic, or new

Checkout recorded commits; obtain frozen Q019 endpoints/source lock; run V1 64-profile
grid; apply V2 aggregation/tests; verify absolute Q019 cross-objective reproduction,
endpoint non-regression, restart stability, history preservation and no gate relaxation.
10. CONCLUSION
Q020 establishes that the large Q019 full-MF cross-profile asymmetry is not primarily an H0
effect. Under the tested four-block decomposition it is dominated by the primordial
(ns,log A ,τ ) direction, while CamSpec-lite shows a much smaller, more distributed
response. The attribution is functional likelihood geometry, not causal physics.

Next Q: Q021
Why: The parameter direction is localized, but the spectra/frequency/nuisance structure
producing it is not.
Question: Which full-MF spectra/frequency combinations and nuisance couplings carry the
Q020 primordial direction, and can they be connected quantitatively to the earlier
ell/frequency response without treating correlated contributions as independent χ²?
REQUIRED END-OF-Q OUTPUT
FINAL ANSWER: Primordial block dominates full-MF response (~71.58%); H0 alone ~2%;
localization confirmed.
Q-JOURNAL: This entry.
MIKAMI GRAVEYARD UPDATE: H0-only driver and additive-independent χ² interpretation
rejected; V1 gate semantics superseded.

Inherited results:
Q021: primordial structure is distributed, not (ns)-only.
Q022: stable mixed cosmology+nuisance multibasin structure exists for masks 3, 6, 7.
Constraints: Reuse validated endpoints; no new likelihood evaluations unless necessary; no
physical causation from parameter motion; Q021/Q022 remain closed.
3. HYPOTHESES
Tested:
H1: Basin families share one reproducible normalized parameter direction across masks.
H2: Directions are mask-dependent/non-universal.
H3: Recurrent individual parameters alone define the common direction.
Rejected: H1 and H3 under fixed-lineage criterion; no seed-pair direction reproduces
across all masks.

10. CONCLUSION
Q023 shows that Q022’s stable full-MF basins are separated by mixed cosmological,
calibration/nuisance, and foreground directions, but no tested direction is reproducibly
shared across masks 3, 6, and 7. The result concerns internal frozen likelihood geometry,
not physical causation or independent observational evidence.
11. NEXT-Q HANDOFF
Why another Q: Fixed seed labels may not identify equivalent basin families across masks.
Next Q: Q024
Next question: After permutation- and sign-invariant matching of the stable Q022 full-MF
basin endpoints across masks 3, 6, and 7, do reproducible basin-family directions emerge,
or does Q023’s mask-dependent structure persist?
REQUIRED END-OF-Q OUTPUT
FINAL ANSWER: Stable basins persist, but their fixed-lineage separating directions are
mask-dependent/non-universal.
Q-JOURNAL: This record.
MIKAMI GRAVEYARD UPDATE: Universal shared basin-direction hypothesis rejected under

11. NEXT-Q HANDOFF
Next Q: Q026
Why: Mask 6 is qualitatively different and its shared-nuisance dominance remains
unexplained.
Question: Can mask 6’s shared-nuisance-dominated geometry be localized to specific
nuisance parameters and covariance/frequency structures, or is it irreducibly distributed?
FINAL ANSWER: Distributed mask-dependent full-MF attribution with strong covariance-
coupled TT frequency structure.
MIKAMI UPDATE: Single-driver explanations killed.

Question: Why does mask 6 become shared-nuisance dominated while masks 3 and 7
remain cosmology dominated, and can this be localized to specific nuisance coordinates,
cosmology–nuisance couplings, or CamSpec covariance/data-model structure without
assuming a systematic?
2. STARTING STATE

Inherited: Q022 stable mixed basins; Q025: masks 3/7 cosmology dominated, mask 6
shared-nuisance dominated with strong TT multifrequency/covariance structure.
Constraint: Fixed validated endpoints; no optimizer; no Q024 permutation rerun;
functional diagnostics ≠ physical causality.
3. HYPOTHESES
Tested:
H1 generic shared-nuisance response.
H2 ( A pl anc k)-centered response.
H3 specific cosmology×nuisance coupling associated with mask-sensitive covariance
structure.
Rejected: Generic/equal nuisance explanation; calTE- or calEE-dominated explanation.
Surviving: ( A pl anc k)-centered mask-6 geometry, dominated by ( ωc d m× A pl anc k).
4. METHOD & EVIDENCE
Method: 252 fixed-vector likelihood evaluations across 9 basin edges; individual nuisance
switches plus all 18 cosmology×shared-nuisance pairs.

5. KEY RESULTS
Mask-6 median absolute nuisance switches:
( A pl anc k=8.6626), (calTE=0.0239), (calEE=0.0374).
Strongest mask-6 pair interactions:
(ωc d m× A pl anc k=25.1681);
(H 0× A pl anc k=7.7736);
(f E D E× A pl anc k=4.7882).
Strongest edges 0–2 and 1–2 coincide with large cancelling TT
(143×143/143×217/217×217) covariance terms around (ℓ=600!−!999).
Final result: Mask 6 is not generically shared-nuisance dominated; its distinctive likelihood
geometry is predominantly ( A pl anc k)-centered, especially through ( ωc d m× A pl anc k).
Limitations: Local functional geometry only; no calibration/systematic/physical-causality
claim.
Contradictions: None.
6. NEGATIVE RESULTS / MIKAMI
Failed attempts: None scientifically relevant in Q026.
Graveyard: Uniform shared-nuisance explanation; calTE-dominated; calEE-dominated;
equal cosmology×nuisance structure. Calibration-failure claim remains NOT ESTABLISHED.
7. MODEL CHANGE
Before: Mask 6 = shared-nuisance dominated.
After: Mask 6 = predominantly ( A pl anc k)-centered, strongest pair ( ωc d m× A pl anc k).
Change: MODIFIED / CONSTRAINED interpretation.
Reason: Q026 coordinate and pair localization.

10. CONCLUSION
Q026 resolves the parameter-side origin of mask 6’s unusual basin attribution: the effect is
overwhelmingly ( A pl anc k)-centered, with (ωc d m× A pl anc k) the dominant local functional
interaction. The same strongest edges also contain extreme cancelling TT multifrequency
covariance structure near (ℓ=600!−!999), but causal direction remains unresolved.
11. NEXT-Q HANDOFF
Why: The bridge between parameter compensation and residual/covariance structure
remains unknown.
Next Q: Q027
Question: Can the mask-6 ( A pl anc k)–(ωc d m) compensation be traced primarily to residual-
vector changes, inverse-covariance weighting, their interaction, or broader mask-sensitive
CamSpec geometry?
REQUIRED END-OF-Q OUTPUT
FINAL ANSWER: Mask-6 shared-nuisance dominance localizes predominantly to ( A pl anc k),
especially (ωc d m× A pl anc k); no physical systematic established.
Q-JOURNAL: This record.
MIKAMI GRAVEYARD UPDATE: Generic/equal shared-nuisance, calTE-dominated and calEE-
dominated terminal explanations rejected.
MODEL CHANGE SUMMARY: Q025 block-level result retained but refined to ( A pl anc k)-

10. CONCLUSION
Q030 confirms that the Q029 interaction-preserving decomposition is numerically valid on
the frozen CamSpec system. The large mask6 structure consists of strongly cancelling
covariance-coupled terms; it cannot be uniquely assigned to data, model, cosmology,
calibration, or a physical systematic.

Why: Main remaining uncertainty is whether this detailed geometry is CamSpec-specific.

Date/time: 2026-09-05, successful run completed 18:54 UTC
Status: REJECTED
Question: Does the distributed, multibasin, mask-dependent, covariance-coupled n=3 EDE
geometry found in frozen Planck NPIPE/CamSpec survive materially under an independent
Planck PR4/NPIPE likelihood implementation?
2. STARTING STATE
Model entering Q: MOD-EDE-N3; n_scf=3; active/constrained;
class_ede@5a131c91d657dd9a7c6364cc45b038710f8d0d97.
Inherited results: Q021–Q030 established distributed primordial response, stable mixed
cosmology–nuisance CamSpec basins, no universal basin direction, distributed attribution,
ω_cdm×A_planck coupling, common-support separation, and exact validated factorial
geometry.
Constraint: test portability without changing frozen physics, retrospectively redefining
basin criteria, summing cross-likelihood objectives, or forcing nuisance equivalence.
3. HYPOTHESES
Tested:
H1: Q022-type stable multibasin geometry survives in independent HiLLiPoP.
H2: Geometry remains separated but fails reproducible stable-basin support.
H3: Implementation fails, leaving portability unresolved.
Rejected: H1 — stable_basin_count=0. H3 — implementation and validation passed.
Surviving: H2 — implementation-specific likelihood geometry; residual separated
endpoints remain.
4. METHOD & EVIDENCE
Method: HiLLiPoP PR4/NPIPE TTTEEE v4.3, same frozen n=3 backend; 9 mapped
multistarts + mandatory tighter refinement; frozen Q022 stability criterion Δobjective 0.50 ≤

Final result: Q021–Q030 stable CamSpec geometry does not port to HiLLiPoP under the
frozen criterion.
Limitation: one independent likelihood tested; mechanism causing non-portability remains
unidentified.
Contradiction: none fundamental; CamSpec vs HiLLiPoP creates implementation-structure
tension.

Q031 rejected cross-implementation portability of the stable Q022-type CamSpec basin

10. CONCLUSION
Q032 found no clean localization of the CASE-031 portability failure to SUPPORT, TE, EE, or
their combinations. Even full-native CamSpec remains non-stable under corrected exact-
start semantics. The historical geometry is therefore best treated as likelihood/execution-
dependent endpoint geometry, not an execution-invariant stable-basin property.

Q031/Q032 classifier, does the reported stable/non-stable discrepancy survive
harmonization?
1. STARTING STATE
Model: MOD-EDE-N3; n_scf=3; class_ede ”5a131c91d657dd9a7c6364cc45b038710f8d0d97”;
active/constrained, not established new physics.
Inherited: Q022 = historically STABLE_MULTIBASIN; Q032/Q034 = non-stable under later
common-geometry classifier. Q033 rejected launch/reference semantics as cause.
Constraint: Existing endpoints only; no new likelihood, optimization, sampling, seeds,
thresholds or physics changes.
2. HYPOTHESES
H1: Discrepancy survives same-classifier comparison. REJECTED.
H2: Classifier semantics materially explain discrepancy. CONFIRMED.
H3: Primordial freeze/sample difference is required explanation. REJECTED as
necessary/sufficient.
3. METHOD & EVIDENCE
Deterministic artifact-only cross-classification of the same Q022/Q032/Q034 endpoint sets
with both source-locked classifier definitions.
Evidence: Q022 run ”33902262660”; Q032 run ”34015845246”; Q034 run ”34059649759”.

Tests: endpoint completeness; reference replay; historical-all-stable; later-all-nonstable; all-
sets-flip; same-classifier-discrepancy-removed; physical-safety; FINAL_RESULT_GATE.
4. KEY RESULTS
Historical Q022 classifier: Q022/Q032/Q034 = STABLE.
Later common-geometry classifier: Q022/Q032/Q034 = NON-STABLE.
Thus both same-classifier cross-case discrepancies = FALSE and all endpoint sets flip
together with classifier choice.

Limitations: Does not determine which classifier is physically preferable; does not establish
identical raw geometry, Planck systematics, EDE evidence/falsification or new physics.
Contradiction discovered: CASE-031 negative portability interpretation is weakened
because Q022 also fails its stable-basin gate under the same later classifier.
5. NEGATIVE RESULTS / MIKAMI
Original Q035 GitHub workflow failed with ”FileNotFoundError” from Q022 artifact path
layout; technical failure only, no scientific evidence.
Graveyard: same-classifier assumption; primordial freeze/sample as necessary/sufficient

disappearance of physical basin structure.

capable of testing whether it materially reduces C-036-IMPL. The discrepancy therefore
remains active and unexplained; no pipeline superiority, EDE confirmation/falsification or
new physics is established.
11. NEXT-Q HANDOFF
Why: The dominant source of RQMC instability remains unidentified.
Next Q: Q041
Question: Is Q040’s finite defensive-RQMC nonconvergence dominated by a small
identifiable subset of nuisance dimensions, boundaries, proposal strata or likelihood-
specific directions, or is it broadly distributed?
REQUIRED END-OF-Q OUTPUT
FINAL ANSWER: INCONCLUSIVE — valid bridge definition exists, but finite numerical
validation failed.
Q-JOURNAL: This entry.
MIKAMI GRAVEYARD UPDATE: Gaussian compression and Q040 finite-RQMC science route
rejected under tested conditions.
MODEL CHANGE SUMMARY: Model unchanged; methodological space narrowed.
REPRODUCIBILITY / GITHUB: Morfindien/Bubbleverse, commit 855a28c…, run
34258155387, Q040-RQMC-V4.
NEXT-Q HANDOFF: Q041 — localize the source of RQMC instability.
LATER ROUTING NOTE (2026-09-24): The Q040 handoff above is preserved as historical
research provenance. The Q041 execution that was ultimately preregistered and run
addressed downstream scientific-consequence portability rather than the proposed RQMC-
instability localization. Q040 is not reopened by this routing change.

Q041
BUBBLEVERSE — Q-JOURNAL
IDENTITY
Q-ID: Q041
Date/time: 2026-09-24 CEST
Status: INCONCLUSIVE / COMPUTATIONAL CAMPAIGN COMPLETE / ORIGINAL SCIENTIFIC QUESTION UNRESOLVED
Question: Does the validated CamSpec–HiLLiPoP fitted-geometry difference in n=3 EDE
produce a materially different downstream cosmological inference when the Planck
likelihood arms are combined with matched external information?
STARTING STATE
Model entering Q: MOD-EDE-N3, n_scf=3 — ACTIVE / CONSTRAINED / NOT ESTABLISHED
NEW PHYSICS.
Inherited: Q035 showed that the historical stable/non-stable basin contrast is classifier
dependent; Q036 established a material continuous CamSpec–HiLLiPoP geometry
difference; Q037 showed that the difference survives exact-common-TT support; Q038
localized the compact multivariate structure to omega_b, omega_cdm, f_EDE, and
theta_i,scf; Q039 rejected calibration, precision coupling, calibration+precision, and native
foreground-profile freedom as sufficient explanations; Q040 defined a legitimate common-
CMB-space marginalization target but failed numerical validation before science
endpoints.
Hard constraints: the Planck arms remain separate; both arms use the same frozen n=3
EDE backend and matched external data; cross-arm absolute likelihood/chi2 subtraction is
forbidden as physical evidence; failed or unconverged chains are not scientific evidence;
Q040-CMBSPACE-* and Q040-RQMC-* scientific products are forbidden as Q041 inputs.
HYPOTHESES / DECISION CLASSES
V19 preregistered three possible scientific classes after all required gates:
MATERIAL_DOWNSTREAM_DIFFERENCE, SCIENTIFICALLY_EQUIVALENT_CONSTRAINTS,
or CONSTRAINED_MIXED.
A technical or convergence gate failure instead yields NO_SCIENTIFIC_RESULT. That state is
a control outcome and is not a fourth physical class.

No authoritative full-matrix standardized shifts, Bhattacharyya coefficient, or leave-one-
out portability classification may be interpreted scientifically because the prerequisite
convergence/completeness gates were not satisfied.
CONTRACT AUDIT
The executed V19 preregistration is not identical to the broader Q041 scientific design that
preceded it. The broader design required matched CamSpec and HiLLiPoP arms, both
ΛCDM and n=3 EDE, ACT DR6 primary, ACT DR6 lensing, DESI DR2, one common frozen
supernova likelihood, a FULL combination plus four leave-one-out combinations, within-
arm ΛCDM-versus-EDE model-preference information, and the original materiality/overlap
decision rules.
V19 instead executes MOD-EDE-N3 only, omits a separate ΛCDM matrix and the supernova
likelihood, uses three leave-one-out combinations, and applies its own six-coordinate
standardized-shift and Gaussian Bhattacharyya classification.
This is a material scope/provenance difference. It does not retroactively invalidate V19: V19
had its own preregistration before the final outcome. It does mean that V19 cannot be
described as the complete execution of the broader original downstream contract.
NEGATIVE RESULTS / MIKAMI
Killed interpretation: Q041 non-convergence => CamSpec and HiLLiPoP physically differ.
Killed interpretation: Q041 non-convergence => CamSpec and HiLLiPoP are scientifically
equivalent.
Killed interpretation: a green GitHub Actions conclusion => a green cosmological result.
Retained prohibition: failed technical runs, timeouts, runner failures, dependency failures,
and resume bugs carry no physical evidentiary weight.
Retained prohibition: Q040 invalidated science endpoints may not be resurrected as Q041
evidence.
MODEL CHANGE
Physical model change: NONE.
C-036-IMPL remains active as a methodological likelihood-geometry discrepancy. Q041
does not determine its downstream physical significance.
New computational knowledge: under the frozen V19 parameterization, sampler settings,
and compute/sample budget, a complete converged posterior matrix was not obtained.
New provenance knowledge: the executed V19 test is narrower than the broader original
Q041 scientific contract.

REPRODUCIBILITY
Reconstruct V19 from the recorded execution commit; verify the preregistration and
source lock; reproduce the same external source versions and Q032 parent; preserve the
eight-stage same-run resume contract; compare the final artifact and validator output;
require the same science gates before any posterior portability interpretation.
Any successor campaign must receive a new version/result identity. Raising max_samples
or changing the sampler after observing V19 without a new preregistered configuration
would retroactively change the test rather than reproduce it.
CONCLUSION
Q041-V19 is complete as a computational campaign and valid as a controlled no-science
result. It did not produce a converged downstream cosmological portability classification.
The original downstream physical question therefore remains unresolved. V19 establishes
neither material downstream difference nor scientific equivalence nor dataset-conditional
mixed behaviour.
Because the executed V19 contract is also narrower than the broader original design, a
future test must explicitly state which scientific contract it is executing rather than silently
merging the two.

Q-ID: Q042 Case-ID: NOT DOCUMENTED Date/time: 2026-10-07 08:00 CEST closure state Status: CLOSED - INCONCLUSIVE
GENERAL FEASIBILITY / NO NEW COSMOLOGICAL INFERENCE
QUESTION
Can the original Q041 downstream-portability test be executed using a newly preregistered, convergence-robust strategy that
preserves both native Planck arms, LCDM and n=3 EDE, ACT DR6 primary, ACT DR6 lensing, DESI DR2, one identical frozen
supernova likelihood, FULL plus four leave-one-out tests and the original materiality/model-preference rules, without reusing
invalidated Q040 science endpoints, cross-arm absolute-objective arithmetic or retrospective criteria changes?
STARTING STATE
Q041-V19 was complete as a controlled computational campaign but produced NO_SCIENTIFIC_RESULT: 30 chains reached the
sample limit, two remained partial, and 0/32 had documented COMPLETE status. Its executed contract was narrower than the
original downstream specification because it omitted the separate LCDM matrix and common supernova block and used three
rather than four leave-one-out combinations. The physical downstream significance of the CamSpec-HiLLiPoP fitted-geometry
difference therefore remained unresolved.
Q040 science endpoints remained forbidden inputs. Cross-arm absolute likelihood or chi-squared subtraction remained forbidden
as physical evidence. A green workflow status could not substitute for convergence, completeness or scientific qualification.
FROZEN SCIENTIFIC CONTRACT
The retained contract required two native Planck arms x two models (LCDM and n=3 EDE) x FULL plus four leave-one-out
combinations, for 20 required inference cells. External blocks remained ACT DR6 primary, ACT DR6 lensing, DESI DR2 and one
identical frozen supernova likelihood. Original priors, overlap rules, materiality rules and model-preference criteria were
unchanged.
Scientific specification SHA-256: 41e4d8f026933f64dbe41048f894002f479ba2b504432b33dc155f4dfe71378c.
PRODUCTION HISTORY
The original Q042 posterior branch failed before completed posteriors were produced. Initial sampler-option leakage was a
configuration failure, not a measured convergence failure. All 80 optimizer records survive: 78 flag-0 records and two flag-3
failures. Their existence does not certify global minima and does not provide posterior portability evidence.

Subsequent bounded diagnostics progressively isolated a numerical reference-construction problem. V22 tested bounded branch
durability/checkpoint behaviour. V23 exposed positive-node spline overshoot in the original binary. V24 recorded a nonfinite
upper optical-depth trial followed by successful return and zero bisection. V25 reproduced a source-consistent finite-input helium-
cutoff overflow followed by propagation of nonfinite state. V26-V28 were retained as RAW_NOT_QUALIFIED diagnostics. V29
initialized the context and 24 explicit interval-box prerequisites but did not qualify a complete history or a scientific result. V30
produced partial conditional histories and failed its frozen inflation construction.
V31 BOUNDED COMPARISON
V31 produced partial conditional histories plus a separate necessary support-cap incompatibility. Both local attempts stopped at
the parent 600-second deadline.
UPPER: 3,741 retained certificates; 3,233/3,334 post-entry native nodes; last retained certificate endpoint z = 1.501953125. LOWER:
3,579 retained certificates; 3,210/3,334 post-entry native nodes; last retained certificate endpoint z = 1.849609375.
Final committed endpoints, complete final counters and peak memory after the parent kill are NOT DOCUMENTED. No full tau
value was computed.
CONDITIONAL MATHEMATICAL RESULT
Frozen support-candidate cap: 32. Retained conservative candidate counts: UPPER 138; LOWER 3,002. Existing minimum upper
bounds: UPPER 0.00024287858999792338; LOWER 0.00024212042562975905. Certified missing-tail source lower bounds: UPPER
1.1628411809721158; LOWER 0.08148057013890592.
Under the frozen source extension, global rails and append-only retention of the existing intervals, the missing tail cannot lower
the relevant minimum threshold or remove the existing candidates. Completing that unchanged representation therefore cannot
satisfy cap32.
This is a conditional failure of an interval representation and output policy. It is not evidence for 138 or 3,002 physical minima, an
executed tau failure, or impossibility of every alternative method.
QUALIFICATION BOUNDARY
The construction concerns existing absolutely continuous solutions of the frozen real-table right-hand side under its stated
domain assumptions. It does not establish existence or uniqueness for the original switched right-hand side, original-binary
arithmetic accuracy, upstream physical/table accuracy, a justified downstream prediction/likelihood error budget, a valid
complete reference, or the convergence-qualified 20-cell comparison.
CURRENT GATES
Q completion: PASS - documented inconclusive closure. Whole history: PARTIAL. Actual support/spline/tau pipeline: NOT
EXECUTED. Unchanged support-cap condition: FAIL within the stated conditional scope. Original-binary arithmetic accuracy:
UNRESOLVED. Upstream accuracy: UNRESOLVED.

Downstream acceptance budget: NOT DOCUMENTED. Reference truth: BLOCKED. Numerical final result: UNRESOLVED.
Production restart: NOT AUTHORIZED.
NEGATIVE RESULTS / MIKAMI
Killed as sufficient repair: simply running the unchanged V31 retained-interval representation longer. Faster or longer execution
cannot remove the independently documented cap32 obstruction under the frozen append-only/global-rail assumptions.
Not killed: LCDM, n=3 EDE, the underlying common-latent mathematical target, or every future contract-preserving numerical
strategy. Technical failures and unqualified diagnostics remain non-physical evidence.
MODEL CHANGE
Physical model change: NONE. H0 benchmarks are unchanged. MOD-EDE-N3 remains ACTIVE / CONSTRAINED. C-036-IMPL
remains a methodological CamSpec-HiLLiPoP geometry tension with unresolved downstream cosmological significance.
Execution-state change: Q042 is no longer an active unchanged execution campaign. The documented tested strategies did not
qualify the original contract, and Q042 closes inconclusively. A materially new qualified design would require a new-case or
explicit reopening decision.

REPOSITORY STATE
At the documented revision point, Morfindien/bubbleverse-model remained accepted through Q041 at model head

72cf9e92fc794c122f593a77b6a555e6e97f6a2e. README and program-registry status lagged the supplied Q042 closure. No remote
synchronization was performed as part of this journal closure.
CONCLUSION
The available tested strategies did not establish execution and scientific qualification of the exact original Q041 downstream-
portability contract. General feasibility remains

inconclusive. Q042 therefore closes as a documented inconclusive feasibility investigation, not as an affirmative production result
and not as a universal impossibility theorem.
The downstream physical question remains unresolved. No posterior portability class, model preference, physical falsification,
pipeline superiority, or new physics follows from Q042.

No new scientific Q-ID is allocated solely from this closure. The next concrete task is operational: TASK-Q042-M14-SYNC-001 -

REQUIRED END-OF-Q OUTPUT
FINAL ANSWER: CLOSED - INCONCLUSIVE GENERAL FEASIBILITY. The documented strategies did not qualify the original
contract; materially different contract-preserving feasibility remains unresolved. MIKAMI: Run-longer is rejected as sufficient
repair of unchanged V31. Technical failure is not physical failure. MODEL CHANGE: No physical change; execution feasibility and
qualification limits refined. NEXT: Repository/model synchronization task; no new scientific Q allocated.
